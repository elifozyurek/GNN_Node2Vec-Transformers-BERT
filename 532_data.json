In this study, to make an interpretation on machinability of MMCs materials, MMCs materials reinforced Al matrix and MgO which were produced in 5%, 10% and 15% reinforcement-volumeratios (R-V) were subjected to machining tests by carbide (C) and coated carbide (CC) cutting tools. Machining tests were conducted with 300 m/dak cutting speed, at three different feed rates (0.075, 0.15 and 0.225 mm/dev) and fixed depth of cut (1 mm). After the machining tests, wear characteristics were examined by the help of scanning electron microscope (SEM) views of cuttingtools and the findings were discussed. In the evaluation of SEM views of cuttingtools, the built up edge(BUE) was observed at the head of all cuttingtools. As not being within the tool life bound, it is deduced that with the increase in feed rate, a trace of flank wear mechanism on C cuttingtools were detected. Generally it is deduced that while CC tools reveal better performance, with regard to tool costs, C tools could be used to operate this kind of MMCs materials",

The ilding simulation model is validated by comparing the simulation results with monthly electricity consumption bills. Shading device requirements are determined by using the building model without shading devices and simulation results are studied together with the sun path diagram analysis results. Hourly and seasonal solar movements are considered as the main parameters affecting the ‘transparency’ and ‘elevation angles’ of the shading devices. As a result of the shading device requirement analysis, climate adaptive shading device (CASD) scenarios are presented for the case building. Consequently, existing shading devices and proposed CASD scenarios are compared and discussed in terms of electricity consumptions and window solar radiation energy parameters. As a result of the comparisons, shading devices that are adaptable to both hourly and seasonal solar movements gave the highest improvement results in terms of decreasing cooling energy consumptions. Also, suggestions are given for developing the best performing façade for further studies.",

The Knelson centrifugal concentrator was used in enrichment studies by gravity separation. It has been determined that the composition of soda-borate based slag with a Au grade 7 g/t consists of relatively high Fe2O3 (13.25%) and PbO (11.38%), and the gold was concentrated in the fraction of -0.5 + 0.212 mm (34%) as a result of the size classification. The influence of operating conditions parameters of Knelson concentrator (washing water pressure, centrifugal force, feed rate, pulp solids ratio, etc.) and feed product particle size on Au grade and gold recovery efficiency of concentrate / waste were investigated. Considering the recovery rate of gold and the amount of gold in the tailings, it was determined that the effect of washing water pressure, centrifugal force and feed rate on the separation performance was limited, and the feed product particle size was effective on concentrate Au grade. A final concentrate containing 16 g/t of Au (Au grade of tailing: 3 g/t) was obtained with 72.4% recovery rate from the slag with 7 g/t Au grade at optimized conditions. In case of applying with the feed product sized of -0,212 mm, where the gold shows the highest distribution by size fraction, the Au grade of the concentrate increased significantly to 30 g/t.",

For this aim, the W44x335 beam is adopted in the buckling analyses carried out by the ABAQUS finite element (FE) program. The strain results at mid-height of the web at mid-span of the beam are taken into account as monitoring parameters. The web strain results are found highly greater than the yield strain value when L/Lr is equal to 1.0. Hence, the elastic limiting length (Lr) is required to be considered greater than the calculated length as per the code formulation. The section is obtained to reach the maximum strain value at the web before the unbraced length (L) is equal to the plastic limiting length (Lp). Therefore, the calculated Lp is estimated with the given analytical formulation to be highly shorter than the length through the FE analysis. These outcomes prove that the formulations of the limiting lengths proposed in the AISC code don’t consider the influence of the web distortion that is predicted to lead to reducing the torsional and warping rigidity of the section. With the study, it is proposed to determine a reduction coefficient by performing more numerical analyzes for different cross sections and free openings in the regulation.",

The study explains how the proposed model proposed can be used in natural language applications to successfully cluster texts. A spectral graph theory method is used to partition the graph into non-intersecting sub-graphs, and an unsupervised and efficient solution is offered for the text clustering problem by providing a physical representation of the texts. Finally, tests have been conducted demonstrating that SSC can be successfully used for text categorization. A clustering success rate of 97.08% was achieved in tests conducted using the TTC-3600 dataset, which contains open-access unstructured Turkish texts, classified into categories. The SSC model proposed performed better compared to a popular k-means clustering algorithm.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the flow characteristics of torpedo-like geometry placed near the free-surface at various angles of attack were investigated numerically. The study was carried out at the Reynolds number of Re=4x104 between immersion ratios of 0.75≤h/D≤3.5 and angles of attack α=0°,4°, 8°, and 12°. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model was used along with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) multiphase model to investigate the effects of free-surface. Wake region had an asymmetrical structure near the free-surface as a result of the interaction. A jet-like flow region was observed between the geometry and the free-surface at lower immersion ratios due to the restriction of the flow area. This flow region had a downward movement towards the lower pressure wake region. The drag coefficient, CD, values were increased with the decrease of immersion ratio. At angles of attack α=8° and 12°, the flow separation occurring near the nose caused an additional restriction in the flow area and directed the jet-like flow toward free-surface. Variation of Froude numbers (Fr) depending on the immersion ratio is examined, and it is found that Fr number and corresponding drag coefficient have higher values for the lower immersion ratio. The free-surface effect was found negligible at h/D≥2.5 for all cases.",

For example, the modulus of elasticity and the permeability of the trabecular bone in a longitudinal and radial direction can vary up to several times. Therefore, implant design that matches these differences is necessary to maximize compliance with the host bone. Given that, in this study, a gyroid structure that generally is used in bone scaffolds was modified to design anisotropic scaffolds. Therefore, the gyroid triply periodic minimal surface trigonometric function was manipulated, and five different architectures were denoted as G(-50), G(-25), G(0), G(+25), and G(+50) with a constant porosity of 80% were developed. The effective elastic moduli of the models were calculated using finite element analysis. The results showed an anisotropicity rate of 0.21, 0.62, 1.50 and 2.23 in elastic moduli for G(-50), G(-25), G(+25) and G(+50) models respectively. As well, the permeability of the models was calculated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. Anisotropic models showed different permeability in longitudinal and transverse directions.  Longitudinal permeability to lateral direction rate were 0.67, 0.80, 1.25 and 1.47 for G(-50), G(-25), G(+25) and G(+50) models respectively.",

        "abstract": "Due to the low hydraulic slope of the Kızılırmak River, the water flow rate is slow. For this reason, mostly fine-grained materials are transported and stored. Since the foundation rock is at lower altitudes, the building foundations near Kızılırmak River are mostly built on fine-grained material. Structural foundations that are not constructed mostly according to the Basic Engineering criteria, cannot exhibit solid-rigid behavior if exposed to excessive water effects in events such as precipitations and riverbed flood. If the drainage conditions are not provided, the negativity increases even more. In this case, the fine-grained base material saturated with water shows more plastic behavior. Due to the plastic behavior, the  building's foundation and walls  lose  their  primary feature and are caused to cracks, decomposition and then deformations. In this study, soil material parameters and drainage conditions are tried to be explained in laboratory conditions for the deformations on the structures in the village of Karabucak near the Kızılırmak river. In case of interaction of fine-grained cohesion materials with water and drainage conditions are not met, it was observed that the pore pressure increased when the liquid limit exceeded 50%. In cases where the liquid limit exceeds 60% and the plasticity index exceeds 20%, the potential for swelling and compression increases. It has been observed that a high rate of damage occurs in these types of structures due to increasing volume changes up to 13% with increasing swelling pressures. Similarly, in terms of shear strength, it has been determined that there is a loss of stability in cohesion below 20 kpa and internal friction angle below 30 °.",

Turkey is one of the countries applying this mechanism. The aim of this study is to provide an overview of the design criteria of the renewable energy auction mechanism and to make recommendations as required to improve the effectiveness of this mechanism. Assessments and recommendations as part of this study shall seek to provide an opportunity to review such auction design criteria, benefiting from past experiences, which shall in turn enhance the effectiveness of new auctions. Applied incentives have boosted the share of RES-E in Turkey in the last ten years. Feed-in-Tariff has driven rapid growth in renewable markets and enhanced manufacturing industries. This analysis results show that a large-scale capacity-based auction volume through a single tender created enough competition and large volumes of renewable energy being secured at lower prices. Within the scope of long-term plans, auctions should be held regularly at predetermined intervals in order to facilitate market predictability for investors, and could lead to competition. Renewable auctions to be carried out should be smaller in volume and be distributed across different geographical regions.",

Sr additions modify Si morphology while grain refiners such as AlTixBy and Ti-free B make dendrite arms smaller in the alloy. Therefore, this study has been performed to evaluate the relationship between casting quality and tensile properties of A356 alloy. The modification and refinement treatments were carried out with three different master alloys: AlSr15, AlTi5B1, and AlB3. The tests were conducted under two conditions:  with and without degassing to evaluate the effect of change in melt quality. Results obtained from experimental studies were analyzed statistically. It was concluded that there is a good relationship between bifilm index and tensile test results when the bifilm index is divided into three groups, namely: poor, medium and high quality. It was found that while Ti grain refinement addition positively affects the mechanical properties, Sr addition has a negative effect on casting quality.",

In the experiments, the effects of MQL application times on axial force, temperature, surface roughness, bushing profile, and thread pull-out strength was investigated. The test results revealed that MQL applications reduced the temperature in the process region and caused an increase in axial force. During the friction drilling process,  it was observed that the axial forces occurred in 7 different zones while the temperature consisted of 2 different zones.The increasing MQL application times were positively affected to hole surface quality and reduced the formation of the material adhesion on the hole wall. Three different bushing profiles were obtained as a parabola, linear, and binary linear depending on the generated heat exchange because of the MQL application times. The test results revealed that the hole surface quality has no effect on the thread pull-out strength, and the combination of the bushing profile and bushing length was decisive. The lowest thread pull-out strength was measured under dry drilling conditions, while the highest thread pull-out strength achieved by 10 seconds of MQL application.",

Especially, in Turkey, there are intensive criticisms about these project’s success concerning economic and environmental aspects. Determining the success criteria and their importance levels are key to remedy these issues since project teams can identify the clear set of the objectives of these projects, and all processes in PPP projects can be performed for achieving these objectives. There are studies about the success criteria of PPP projects in the literature. However, none of these studies focuses on Turkey. Given the fact that success criteria vary concerning the country’s cultural, economic, and traditional background, success criteria specific to Turkish PPP projects must be determined. Additionally, success criteria also vary among the different stakeholders, and unawareness of these differences puts the project success at risk. Thus, differences in perspectives of the public and private sectors were also investigated in this study. Firstly, 15 success criteria were extracted from the literature. Then, a questionnaire survey was organized to collect expert’s opinion about the importance of these criteria. 33 experts participated in this questionnaire survey. The data collected through the questionnaire survey was analyzed by using factor analysis and 4 factors were determined at the end of this analysis. Finally, the Mann-Whitney U test was performed to investigate the differences in perspectives of the public and private sectors. The factor analysis shows that the most important factors are project delivery and the project’s contribution to the public’s prosperity. Besides, the findings indicated that stakeholders have considerable disagreements on three criteria, namely quality of the project with meeting output specifications, reliable and quality public service, and reduced public sector administrative costs.",

These techniques have proven to be an effective method in distinguishing malicious network packets. One of the most challenging problems that researchers are faced with is the transformation of data into a form that can be handled effectively by Machine Learning Algorithms (MLA). In this paper, we present an IDS model based on the decision tree C4.5 algorithm with transforming simulated UNSW-NB15 dataset as a pre-processing operation. Our model uses Term Frequency.Inverse Document Frequency (TF.IDF) to convert data types to an acceptable and efficient form for machine learning to achieve high detection performance. The model has been tested with randomly selected 250000 records of the UNSW-NB15 dataset. Selected records have been grouped into various segment sizes, like 50, 500, 1000, and 5000 items. Each segment has been, further, grouped into two subsets of multi and binary class datasets. The performance of the Decision Tree C4.5 algorithm with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Naive Bayes (NB) has been compared in Weka software. Our proposed method significantly has improved the accuracy of classifiers and decreased incorrectly detected instances. The increase in accuracy reflects the efficiency of transforming the dataset with TF.IDF of various segment sizes.",

These elements lead to relatively more complicated systems and increase the total weight. In contrast, reaction force observers can estimate external forces acting on the system and thus enable torque control with no need of torque sensing. The estimation process performs better for backdrivable systems, therefore, its implementation to non-backdrivable systems, e.g., systems with a gear ratio of 1:100, is limited. To remedy this issue, a reaction force observer-based torque controller was designed and implemented.

        "abstract": "Waste production is an important problem for the developing world and globalization. The waste materials can be reused through recycling process and its environmental effects can be minimized. Utilizing renewable energy sources at the maximum level is also an important issue for a sustainable development in future as well as waste management. In this study, small-scale solar air heating systems were produced from waste materials to analyze the usability of waste material in renewable energy systems. Scrap metal elbows were used in the production of heaters. The first solar heater is hollow (SH) and the second one was modified by filling it with aluminum wool (SHAW). Both heaters were tested simultaneously at different flow rates (0.014, 0.010 and 0.006 kg/s). According to the experimental results, the thermal efficiency values for SH and SHAW were found in the range of 33.63-42.90% and 42.69-56.98%, respectively. In addition, it was observed that a low cost modification such as using aluminum wool can significantly increase thermal performance of the solar heating system.",

Graphene and its derivatives have also attracted great interest in the field of polymer composites, since the use of graphene as a small amount of additive brings about advanced properties to the polymers. Therefore, in this study, graphene was added to the epoxy at certain rates (0.05%, 0.1%, 0.25%, 0.5% and 1%) to obtain nanocomposites with improved electrical conductivity and mechanical properties. The properties of obtained nanocomposite films were examined by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), mechanical test, scanning electron microscope (SEM), UV-Vis-NIR spectrophotometer and electrical conductivity measurements. 1% graphene additive caused a 28.2% decrease in the volumetric resistance and 9.7% in the surface resistance of the nanocomposite films. The maximum tensile value of graphene/epoxy nanocomposites was obtained as ~ 20 MPa by increasing 33.84% in 1% graphene additive compared to neat epoxy-based nanocomposites. As a result, it has been observed that as the amount of graphene added to the epoxy increases, the electrical conductivity, tensile values and light absorption of nanocomposite films increase. The nanocomposite films obtained can be used in industrial applications thanks to the improved electrical conductivity and mechanical properties.",

        "abstract": "Bentonites and sand-bentonite mixtures are usually used for impervious barriers at nuclear waste repositories, municipal solid waste landfill liners, etc. These mixtures should be able to perform for a long time without changing their strength and hydraulic conductivity properties. The literature studies have shown that high temperature and thermal cycles have negative effects on the hydraulic conductivity and strength of soils. For example, hydraulic conductivity increases in the presence of high temperature. For that reason, the resistivity of bentonites and sand-bentonite mixtures should be increased against high temperatures when they are used in liners. Boron minerals are used in order to increase the thermal resistivity of materials in industry. Hence the boron mineral namely; ulexite can be added to the sand-bentonite mixtures in order to improve strength and hydraulic conductivity properties of these mixtures against high temperature or thermal cycles. In this study, the compaction, consolidation, hydraulic conductivity and shear strength properties of ulexite added sand-bentonite mixtures were investigated at room temperature. Additionally, the shear strength behavior of ulexite added sand-bentonite mixtures was investigated under high temperature (80°C). The sand-bentonite mixtures were prepared which contains 10% bentonite by weight. The 10% and 20% ulexite were added to these mixtures. The mixtures were prepared according to the compaction test results (dry unit weight and optimum water content+2%). According to the test results, as the ulexite additive decreased the optimum water content value and increased the maximum dry unit weight. When the ulexite was added to the sand-bentonite mixtures, amount of the total vertical strain (compressibility) increased as the ulexite percentage increased. The maximum shear stress value of sand-bentonite mixtures in the presence of ulexite at 80°C was generally higher than those of at room temperature.",

There is particular interest in metal nanoparticles due to their distinctive properties.  Silver nanoparticles (Ag-NPs) have been of particular interest owing to their unique electrical, optical and physicochemical properties as well as their biomedical applications. Ag-NPs are the fastest growing class of nanoscale materials because of their antibacterial activities. They are now considered to be the next generation antimicrobials. Today, owing to their disinfectant properties, Ag-NPs are extensively used in numerous consumer products, including disinfecting medical devices and home appliances, paints, optical devices, plastics, textiles, soaps and laundry detergents, cosmetics, health-care products, as well as in food packing and food products as preservative and anti-caking agents. Despite their widespread usage, the products containing Ag-NP additives are a serious environmental and human health concern because of their toxicity.  Studies on cell and bacterial cultures have shown that Ag-NPs are toxic; and the toxic effects are mainly due to the dissolved Ag ions when Ag-NPs degrade in water. In this study, considering the criteria outlined above, the purpose of the study and Ag-NPs were chemically synthesized in the laboratory environment and modified as chitosan coating.

The proposed system encodes three different signals according to four information bits while the traditional system encodes one signal by one information bit. In this study, it is aimed to develop a modulator to produce a signal which has a better spectral efficiency than the traditional system thanks to a bit that is called as dimming level control bit.  By using four message bits, the proposed modulator generates the signals of which dimming levels are %25-%50-%75 or %75-%50-%25, respectively. The dimming level control bit provides the controlling of 25% and 75% dimming level signals. From the simulation results, it has been observed that proposed structure has performed better compared to signal (25%, 30%, 70% and 75%) with respect to both bit error rate and spectral efficiency instead of 40%, 50% and 60% dimming signals. Moreover, the proposed method has been applied to secure image communication since the dimming level control bit encodes the position of 25% and 75% dimming levels in the proposed structure. For traditional system, the message bits are obtained as 25% missing due to the fact that the system can not decode dimming control bits, although the dimming level knowledge of the demodulator at receiver side has been considered as 100%. In addition, a detailed theoretical infrastructure has been established for both the proposed receiver and transmitter.",

For this purpose, the pitch and heave motions were coupled to each other during the pitch motion by changing the positions of the pitch and heave oscillation centers according to each other. The degree of coupling is determined by the front and rear spring stiffness. For this, the half-vehicle model that can be coupled to the two-quarter vehicle model with the suspension components were used. With this model, the effects of coupling on dynamic wheel load oscillations were examined in frequency domain according to the location of the center of gravity and vehicle speed. The results showed that the position changes of the oscillation centers can reduce both the front and rear dynamic wheel load oscillations, and this will be slightly affected by vehicle speed variation. It has also been found that this improvement depends on how the damping level of the shock absorber on a wheel will vary with respect to the change in the suspension spring.",

Considering the classification accuracy of the algorithms used in the study, based on the total number of correctly classified samples, it was seen that the model of the MLP performed best with 87,26% accuracy rate, followed by the linear SVM model with 86,32% and our proposed model with 75,47% accuracy rate.

General expressions are proposed for fully developed dimensionless heat transfer coefficient Nusselt number and fully developed Darcy friction factor in terms of Reynolds number and side angle for hexagonal-shaped cross-sectional duct. Results show that side angle of hexagonal duct affects the pressure drop along duct and heat transfer coefficient in duct. Results point out that regular hexagonal duct, =60o, gives minimum pressure drop and maximum Nusselt number.

Prismatic mortarsamples with 40x40x160 mm dimensions were produced from the mixtures and a half of samples were stored in a room having65% RH and 22±2ºC while the other half of samples were stored in water bath which had same temperature until test days. After7, 28, 90 and 180 days of curing, the compressive strengths, flexural strengths and Los Angeles abrasion resistances of thesamples were measured. The results obtained from this research showed that curing conditions on the mortars containing slag hadan important effect.

As far as it is impossible to avoid radioactive rays, protective measures should be taken toreduce the harmful effects of radiation. Radiation can shred or damage the cell depending upon the radiation exposure time,severity and exposed parts of body. To be protected from the harmful effects of radiation time, distance and armor rules must beobserved.Shielding process is placing appropriate barriers between the radiation source and person with the aim of reducing theradiation to an acceptable level. The higher the density of the materials used the more skied-effect increases. The factors ofchoosing the shield material are type of radiation source, energy level, bigger atomic number of material and containinghydrogen ion in the structure of material. Heavy concrete used as shield material which is produced from heavy aggregatesincluding both hydrogen ion and higher density makes it inevitable to use as a shield material. On the design of the shieldthickness, the properties of places that are to be armored are also important.

On a closer look on the today design strategytrends, it can be observed that the vernacular architecture already utilizes basic principles of sustainability. Impact of cultural andsocial life of the locals also plays an important role in the formation of the traditional architecture. When we look at thevernacular architecture in context of sustainable design criteria, it is understood that the settlements are compatible to thetopographic features, and it is planned according to climate data and natural structure. As the people in rural areas are not familiarwith the terms; sustainability and ecology, they prefer the variety of the products of consumption economy. This paper willdiscuss about the architectural features of the towns Adatepe and Demircikoy through the ecologic criteria. The vernacularhouses in these towns will be analyzed in three main topics; the construction, the materials, and the spatial organization, whichcan be used in a roadmap for planning the future of the rural settlements in Canakkale region",

        "abstract": "Food processing studies are important for bothefficient use of energy and to obtain quality products. Yoghurt is a dairyproduct which consumes widely. Yoghurt producing facilities consumes highenergy and run at low efficiency due to their traditional production methods.In order to produce quality yoghurt, pasteurized milk should be kept at 42-45oC for 3-5 hours depending on the yeast type, this process called asincubation. After the incubation process, produced yoghurt must be cooled downto 20 oC in two hours depending on the package size of yoghurt. In conventionalyoghurt production facilities, required heating and cooling are appliedindependently and this approach causes high energy consumptions, waste heat andthe inefficient use of energy. In this study, a combined system consisting of aheat pump and a heat storage unit which is capable of the simultaneouslyheating and/or cooling application independently of each other is designed toensure higher energy performance and efficiency. Thus, the required energy forheat transfer from the evaporator and cooling after the incubation process wasensured from the stored ice and, independently of the weight of the product,64/68 units of energy (depending of refrigerant) were gained for each 100 unitsof required heating energy.The coefficient of performance (COP) of the systemusing R410a and R134a for heating, cooling and dual operation modes werecalculated as 2.83, 1.83, 4.66 and 3.16, 2.16, 5.31, respectively. Energy costsfor heat pump and conventional natural gas-fuel-oil boilers were compared. Highenergy efficiency and low energy consumption have been provided with thepresented design, and suggestions for use for production facilities are given.",

The amount of cement was replaced by SF at 0% (RC):  2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10% and 12.5% by weight, respectively. Six 100 x 100 x 100 mm cube test samples were produced with these mixtures. Slump and Ve-Be tests were carried out on processability tests on fresh concrete.   28, 90 and 120 days compressive strength tests were performed on hardened concrete samples.In all mixtures, it was found that there was an inverse relationship between SF ratio and workability. SF ratio was effective on the processability of fresh concrete. As the SF content of the mixtures increased, the precipitation decreased and the Ve-Be duration was extended time.In all mixtures, there was a certain increase in compressive strength naturally depending on the age of the concrete. In fiberless samples, the compressive strength increased as the ratio of SF to RC’ increased. The highest compressive strength of all ages was obtained with 7.5% SF. In fiber samples (FC):  compressive strength increased as SF ratio increased. The highest compressive strength increase at all ages was obtained in samples produced with 10% SF ratio",

In this study, a model was developed based on Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) for estimation of PPE usage of enterprises. In an enterprise operating in the white goods sector, the usage data of respiratory protective masks in 2015-2019 has been examined and the need for respiratory protective masks that may arise for 2020-2022 has been estimated. The effectiveness of our method was examined by comparing the estimates made with the amount of PPE usage. Increasing relationships between man and machine in the industrial era require the creation of human-compatible businesses, and in this sense, ergonomics can benefit from occupational health and safety practices in order to improve productivity. The PPE estimates made gave close results to the actual use of respiratory protective masks. This study for the estimation of the amount of use of protective masks can also be applied for the prediction of other personal protective equipment used throughout the business in the future.",

In accordance with this purpose, the design of missile structures has become more important than ever. In this study, the design and analyses of a subsonic rocket was carried out with the utilization of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools. Also, the effects of several critical parameters; i.e. Mach number, turbulence intensity, turbulence model, on the rocket performance were investigated. It was found out that a variation in Mach number has a substantial effect on the drag coefficient; i.e. an increment in Mach number at approximately 30% results in an increment of drag coefficient nearly 68%.  Contrarily, changing the turbulence intensity does not make any significant difference on drag coefficient. Although the appropriate turbulence intensity should be used for every unique problem, in this case, this parameter is not a critical variable to ponder upon. Finally, the implementation of the appropriate turbulence model is critical in the design process as expected. Utilization of k-ω and k-ω SST models differs approximately 12% in terms of drag coefficient; the drag coefficient obtained from k-ω is higher than that of obtained from k-ω SST.",

In skin cancer, as in other types of cancer, early diagnosis is vital in the treatment process. Today, in the diagnosis of skin cancer, besides traditional methods, computer technology based methods such as Image Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Artificial Neural Networks are frequently used. The most important advantage of these methods is that they do not contain human errors during the diagnosis process. On the other hand, one of the biggest problems is the inaccuracy in the diagnosis of cancer due to the fact that the hair cleansing and lesion segmentation cannot be performed correctly.This study presents a new UNET-based approach to clearing skin cancer lesions from hair noises and lesion segmentation. Two data sets of International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) were used in the study. As a result of the study, a success rate of 92% in hair removal and approximately 94% in lesion segmentation was achieved.",

The nonlinear absorption properties and ultrafast charge transfer dynamics of all grown crystals were investigated by using open aperture Z-scan and ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy techniques. The studied crystals showed nonlinear absorption at 1200nm wavelength with \t100fs pulse duration. Nonlinear absorption coefficients increase with 0.1%Er and 0.1%Ce doping atoms. This behavior also leads to increasing of the free carrier densities with doping atoms and occurring of the excited states absorption. Second harmonic generation signals of the crystals were measured by fiber optic spectrometer. Second harmonic generation signals of the doped GaSe crystals shifted blue region of the spectrum as compared to the undoped GaSe crystal. According to ultrafast pump-probe experimental results, the undoped GaSe crystal indicates continuous excited state absorption signal while the doped GaSe crystals indicate saturable absorption behaviors after 2ns time delay between 630nm-650nm region corresponding to bottom of the conduction band. The saturable absorption signals indicate that the defect states which are occurred with doping atoms in crystal are localized under the conduction band. In conclusion of the experimental results, nonlinear absorption properties, frequency conversion and ultrafast charge transfer dynamics of the crystals can be controlled by doping atoms in crystals.",

        "abstract": "Recent developments in IT has increased the speed ofdata production and processing, as a result, big data concept with componentssuch as volume, velocity, variety and value has emerged. In order to get morebenefit from big data, it is necessary to share or publish the data bypreserving or respecting privacy. The literature reviews report that there isno model that facilitates publishing big data by preserving privacy. DesigningPrivacy Preserving Big Data Publishing (PPBDP) models is important to directall the parties and to meet the requirements of them correctly, and to createthe right infrastructures and services. In addition, it is necessary to considersome factors such as cost and security when designing these models.In this study, privacy preserving data publishingmodels were reviewed, compared based on various criteria and then evaluated basedon privacy risk levels. Finally, big data architecture based new conceptual modelswere then established for the first time according to these evaluations and privacyrisk levels. It is expected that the proposed models might contribute to theliterature on some issues, such as publishing big data with preserving privacy,minimizing privacy risks and obtaining maximum benefit from the big data.",

There are many types and profiles of springs.  For a round wire helical compression or tension spring of small pitch angle, the Wahl factor, a  correction factor (Cw) taking into account curvature and direct shear stress, is generally used in the design. The corresponding stress concentration factors, which may be useful for mechanics of materials problems, are obtained by taking the nominal shear stress τnom as the sum of the torsional stress (τ) and the direct shear stress (τ)  for round wire. In the case of the wire of square cross-section, τnom is the sum of the torsional stress and the direct shear stress. For design calculations it is recommended that the simpler Wahl factor be used. The same value of max will be obtained whether one uses Cw or Kts. This study contains the determination of stress concentration factor and Wahl factor. For this aim, stress concentration factor charts were converted numerical values for round and square wires. These values  were collected in an excel file. ANN (Artificial  Neural Networks) model was developed using the data. It is an easy and convenient method, ANN model, was presented for the determination of stress concentration and Wahl factor for spring design.",

The main purpose of this network architecture is to combine thetraditionalfeatures obtained from the LM filters and thedeep features obtained from the CNN architecture so thus create a strongfeature data for classification. In the proposed model, the LM filter featuresand deep features of the pedestrian image are calculated simultaneously. Then,these features are combined and features vector consisting ofdifferent features is built.Thisfeature vector is taken into the classification process with the help of fullyconnected layer. The developed HESA architecture has been applied for thepedestrian attribute classification which is a very difficult problem. Theproposed model significantly outperforms the SVM and MRF based methods on thePETA database. In addition, the use of the ReduceLROnPlateau model in the HESAmethod has made a significant contribution to achieving high successes.",

Furthermore, repair or replacement is expensive and time consuming. To avoid this, methods and systems for monitoring and protecting of power transformers in service have been developed in recent years. To avoid the needless trip by magnetizing inrush current, the second harmonic component is commonly used for blocking differential relay in power transformers. This paper describes a new approach for power transformer differential protection that ensures security for inrush phenomenon during switching on. For this purpose, a new AC drive circuit is designed and implemented in a laboratory environment. Finally, we compare the behavior of this new drive for real cases of magnetizing inrush conditions",

In the experimental studies, steel balls which are 8 mm in diameters and with 10/1 ball-powder ratio was used. It was observed that when no lubricant is used, the alloying powders started to break up without flaky during the MA process. Depending on MA time, ZA alloying powders with different sizes were produced. These powders were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Then Zinc-Aluminum powders were hot pressed in the mold under 625 MPa pressure at 320 °C and sintered at the same temperature.After the sintering process, densities of specimens were specified and SEM plus EDS studies were done for their microstructural characterizations. Optimum MA time was found to be 4 hours in terms of powder size in all ZA alloys. When original chemical composition of ZA alloys is taken into account, the ratio of A1 was higher than expected, whereas the ratio of Zn was lower. According to element distribution map results, it was seen that Cu was homogeneously distributed through the structure and Al and Zn were oxidized. The densities of ZA alloys after the MA process and under cold press conditions were higher than their densities after sintering",

In this study, the effect ofvarying fuel properties on engine performance and exhaust emissions ofn-hexadecane additive added to diesel fuel was investigated. As a result of theexperiments, while the viscosity of n-hexadecane added fuels decreased, thecetane number increased. This improvement in fuel properties leads to betteratomization and increased combustion quality when fuel is injected into thefuel cylinder. As a result, the best improvement was obtained at 16%n-hexadecane (DHD16) ratio. At 2800 1/min, the power increases by 1.06%compared to diesel fuel (D0) while the brake specific fuel consumptiondecreases by 2.38%. Carbon monoxide (CO) emission decreases by 10.24%,hydrocarbon (HC) emission decreases by 19.31% and smoke emission decreases by19.96%. Improvement of combustion quality caused increase of heat emissionwhile nitrogen oxide (NOx) increased the emission by 6.66%.

Optimum machining conditions was aimed to be determined by investigating the effects of cutting parameters on surface roughness. For this purpose, the machining tests were performed without coolant on a CNC turning centre at four different cutting speeds (250, 350, 450 and 550 m/min), two different feed rates (0.1 and 0.2 mm/rev) and two different tool tip radii (0.4mm ve 0.8 mm). The experimental design was conducted according to Taguchi’s L8 orthogonal array. Machining experiments were carried out on CNC lathe under dry cutting conditions.

The control of the 3D printers is usually done bythe classical Propotional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control algorithm. In thisstudy, we have developed for the designed 3D printer a new software by usingadaptive PID control algorithm instead of classical PID. Five step motors ofthe designed 3D printer are controlled by the adaptive PID. In addition, thereare both heating and cooling processes in the extruder system and theseprocesses are controlled by the adaptive PID. The mechanical design uses a beltand pulley drive system which is suitable for accelerated movements. In thesystem software, 3D Printing Software Pipeline (input model, orientation andpositioning, support structures, slicing, path planning, machine instructions)is applied. The control algorithms for extruder and step motors are prepared asseparate function files in software implemented in C.

Production of H2with zero emission,safe storage, efficient distribution and, highly efficient energy conversion inend-use are the most important factors for popularizing the use of hydrogenenergy systems in daily life. The main target is to develop alternativetechniques to produced hydrogen with zero emission instead of fossil-basedsources. In particular, magnesium (Mg) from light weight metals has been gainattention to achieve this target.  While,Mg and Mg alloys are mainly used as a raw material in automotive, spaceengineering, metallurgy and chemistry sectors, cells and cathodic protection,%50 of raw Mg is formed as a waste. However, only 33% of these wastes are classifiedbased on waste managent and reused is being possible.In this research article, the evaluation of theindustrial waste grade Mg chips in the production of H2gas is studied.H2production is carried out based on the hydrolysis reaction and itis necessary to use an activator which accelerates the passage of H+ions and chlorine salts, metals and acids are preferred for this purpose. Theusage of different concentrations of vinegar solutions (0.8-4 % wt. aceticacid, CH3COOH) as an activator in hydrolyses meduim wasinvestigated. Hydrogen prodcution was carried our from waste Mg chip and H2gas production profiles were illuminated.",

At the end of 100 seconds, the control key inMATLAB/Simulink block diagram was changed and the control algorithm wasactivated and different set point changes were given to the system at the sametime and the effect of the parameters was observed. It was seen that the liquidlevel tended to level off around the desired set values in the wireless controlexperiments performed to follow different set points by using the wirelessrobust error control with well-tuned parameters.

In addition, microstructuralexaminations were performed on the welded specimens in order to observestructural the changes and transformations occurring in the welding zone. Thehardness test results showed that the highest hardness values are seen for theweld metal and these are followed by heat affected zone (HAZ) and basematerial. After the tensile tests, it was seen that all the specimens fracturedat the meld metal and that strength of the joints lower than that of basematerial. It was observed from the microstructural examinations that firstpasses are fine grained isotropic while the last passes are fine grainedcolumnar. In addition, martensitic transformation due to rapid cooling was seenin the specimens joined at underwater. When the experimental results aregenerally evaluated, it is seen that the specimens joined through underwaterarc welding method exhibited 30 % lower elongation and 12 % lower tensilestrength than those joined at the atmospheric conditions.",

CO2, N2and steam have been suppliedinto the flame zone as diluents for different Reynolds (Re) numbers. Acomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) code (Ansys Fluent) has been used andmodellings have been performed by it in the present study. The PDF/MixtureFraction combustion model and P-1 Radiation model have been used. Differentturbulence models have also been used in combustion modellings andthe bestturbulence model has been determined. After combustion modellings have beencarried out, NOXpredictions have been taken place with NOXpost processor in this CFD code based on thermal and prompt NOXmechanisms and the effects of the diluents have been investigated numerically.According to the results, It has been seen that center-fed diluents havecontributed suppression of NOXemissions forming in the methaneflame. When the diluents are evaluated each other, it has been determined thatsteam enables more reduction of NOXemissions forming in the methaneflame in comparison to CO2and N2. This reduction hasbeen provided from 45 ppm to 30 ppm. It can be concluded from the present studythat supplying diluents as microjet has also contributed reduction of NOXemissions as well as it affects flame stabilization.",

Turkey’s gross electricity consumption reached 278.3 billionkWh in 2016 and electricity demand is projected to increase 367.9 billion kWhin low-demand scenario or 407.9 billion kWh in high-demand scenario by 2023.However, T&D losses in Turkish electricity grid were 14.2% in 2015 whichwas more than twofold of OECD average. This paper provides an overview of theT&D losses in Turkey, highlights the growing role of the distributedgeneration and smart meters and prioritize distribution regions where smartmeters can be implemented. The paper finds that T&D losses can be decreasedfrom current level to 12.38% in 2023 by investing nearly 2.2 billion Dollars.Though reaching OECD level is very difficult task to achieve and apparentlyTurkey won’t get OECD level before 2030, increasing the penetration ofdistributed generation and implementation of smart meters to decrease technicaland non-technical losses can be the key solutions for increasing energyefficiency in the Turkish power grid.",

This paper presents the results of a study on the dynamic characteristics of sand/rubber mixtures under dynamic loading conditions at low and middle shear strain level. Also, the information about the energy absorption capability, initial shear modulus and damping ratio of the mixtures are obtained. A number of torsional resonant column tests were conducted on sand/rubber mixtures with different particles sizes and contents to evaluate the shear modulus and damping values. To simulate the stress-strain response of cyclic-induced loading, the measurements were taken for different confining pressures and strain levels. The results of the study indicated that rubber modification increases stiffness and damping ratio, making it a very attractive material for geotechnical applications. The modulus reduction curves, shear modulus and damping ratio graphics are presented with the percentage of rubber and sand mixtures. Rubber’s high damping capacity permits consideration of rubber/soil mixtures as part of a damping system to reduce vibration. It’s found out that mixtures of sand and rubber can be modeled using conventional principles of mechanics with some revisions",

Huge amounts of waste materials and industrial by-products are generated from manufacturing processes and other processes. Utilization of waste materials and by-products is now a necessity for sustainable development and better living environment. Large volumes of earthen materials are used in construction each year in Turkey and elsewhere in the world. Also, sub-base filling materials are a common problem for highway construction in many parts of the world. Large amount of wastes have the potential to be used in the mixtures of the road sub-base filling materials in appropriate proportions. The usual approach for sub-base stabilization is to remove the low-bearing capacity materials, and replace with a high-bearing capacity material. One alternative method is to improve the low grade materials by (e.g. waste material) stabilization. In this study, the unconfined compressive strength and stiffness of base layers stabilized using industrial wastes, namely fly ash and marble dust areinvestigated. They were added in different ratios of 5%, 10 %, and 15% into natural soils for assessment of their possible use in highway base construction. The samples were cured for 7 and 14 days. Standard compaction and California Bearing Ratio (CBR) values weredetermined for all mixed samples at the two curing ages.

The thermal performance of the outer walls was determined using the hot box method (according to EN ISO 8990). In the hot box experiment, outdoor temperature was chosen as -5 oC and indoor temperature as 27 oC. Five different walls were built for the experimental study. These are respectively; uninsulated and plastered  on the inside, 1 are uninsulated and plastered on both sides and insulated with 3 XPS boards (3, 4 and 5 cm thick). Wall surface temperatures in cold and hot sections were measured for 480 minutes and the overall thermal conductivity coefficient (U value) of the walls was calculated according to EN ISO 8990. The most suitable thermal insulation material thickness was found to be 5 cm and U value was found to be 1.943 W/m2K on the walls that were heat insulated with XPS. U values of single-wall plastered (KD-1) and two-surface plastered (KD-2) walls were obtained as 4.565 W/m2K and 4.364 W/m2K, respectively. According to the results of the statistical analysis, the increase in the thickness of the insulation on the walls using XPS thermal insulation material did not reveal a significant difference and XPS insulated walls were included in the same group. It was determined that the thermal performance of XPS insulated walls is quite high compared to non-insulated control walls.",

The experiments were carried out according to the L9 orthogonal array, and Rz, Sm and hardness values were measured as processing performance outputs. Finally, the fatigue life of the machined parts was estimated by applying the √area model and the change of theoretical fatigue life according to the machining parameters was investigated. According to experimental results, an increase in Rz and Sm parameters was determined with increasing the discharge current and pulse on time. The lowest Rz and Sm values were obtained at 3 A discharge current, 3 µs pulse on time and 5 µs pulse off time.

In this study, sintered powder metal (P/M) materials were produced by hot pressing of pre-mixed Alumix 123 powder with w.t. 1.5% zinc stearate (ZnSt) lubricant. The pre-mixed Alumix 123  powder with lubricant were mixed for 40 minutes in the three-dimensional mixing device and pre-compression was carried out at pressures of 100, 300 and 500 MPa. Then, the die temperature was increased by 50°C and kept for 15 minutes in between 300-450°C. By this way, a total of 1 hour lubricant removal process was performed. Subsequently, hot pressing active sintering was applied for 30 minutes under a pressure of 50 MPa at 540°C. The same processes were applied to the pre-mixed Alumix123 powders without lubricant, except the mixing process. Diffusion annealing (DA) with eutectic temperature change (548C10C) was applied to the produced P/M materials. Density measurements according to Archimedes principle and hardness measurements of P/M materials were made. Metallographic examinations of these produced parts were carried out.  At the same time optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM/XRF) and also X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyzes were performed. Increasing the pre-compression pressure in lubricant-free P/M materials decreased the pore density and increased the relative density. The lubricant removal effect with increasing pre-compression pressure and the relative density of P/M materials reduced. It has been determined that the density, hardness and alloying rate of the samples produced without lubricant are higher than those with lubricant.",

When the progress in technology has accelerated, it was caused technological pressures in production field and it has led to revolutions in these pressure. New technologies, such as cyber-physical systems, cloud technologies, the internet of things, autonomous systems, big data, virtual reality and 3D printer technologies have also become the elements of pressure that they have led to an industrial revolution. Each of these technologies has devoloped independently and have different application areas but thanks to synergy obtained when used together, they achieved to move production from traditional structure to smarter production level. Physical factories which were firstly became digitized and than secondly virtualized, turned into \"smart factories\" with this synergy. Starting at the idea stage of a physical product and based on the idea of obtaining a virtual copy with real-time data throughout the life of the product, the Digital Twins managed to become a key technology that brings out synergy by using the technologies mentioned in the realization of smart factories. The purpose of this article is contribute to the literature to understand the place, importance and future potential of the Digital Twin concept in smart production systems and processes and also develop a reference point in the context of Industry 4.0.",

        "abstract": "The study involves the characterization of the Ta2O5 coated AZ91 Magnesium (Mg) alloys produced using the sol-gel method. Mg alloys have a serious potential for use in orthopedic applications due to their lightness and mechanical properties close to the mechanical properties of human bone. However, their corrosion resistance is insufficient for long-term use within the body. Tantalum (Ta), on the other hand, is an element with a high corrosion resistance and does not create a toxic effect on the body thanks to the oxide layer formed on its surface. In this study, it was aimed to cover Ta2O5 in different dipping numbers with the sol-gel method on AZ91 Mg alloys produced by powder metallurgy method and to investigate the effect of this change on the morphology of the coatings. After the samples were coated in different dipping numbers, the change in their morphology was examined using electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). As a result of the study, it was observed that the distance between the islets was shortened in the cracked structures encountered in the sol-gel method. With the increasing number of dipping, samples with an average coating thickness of 1, 3 and 7 µm were produced and a more homogeneous coating structure was created on the surface.",

Structural properties of the coatings were analysed by of SEM and XRD. In vitro ability was investigated by soaking the coated NiTi samples in simulated body fluid (SBF) at temperature 37 °C for various time periods. After soaking, Ni+2 release was applied to the media where coated and uncoated shape-memory NiTi samples are available, and its control was made by means of ICP-MS device. The results also show that Toxic and carcinogenic effects of Ni+2 release is significantly reduced by the TiO2 coating. Thus, it is observed that the properties that limit the use of NiTi alloys has been substantially fixed by MAO coating. It was found that the bioactive properties of the TiO2 coated NiTi substrate increased by MAO method and at the end of the 72 hour, there was no statistically any cytotoxicity in cell viability compared to the NiTi substrate",

Thermodynamic analyses showed that the micro-CHP system was capable of reaching 87% of cycle efficiency with 70 kWe of electrical and 115 kWt of thermal power, respectively. Moreover, II. Law analysis revealed inefficiencies across the system such that the high temperature heat exchanger had the lowest exergy efficiency of 63.7% which is the part requiring improvement. The economic analyses showed that the system could generate $22.10/month of economic return per flat and the payback period was found to be 5.48 years. Lastly, environmental analysis indicated that how environmentally friendly the CHP system is and argued that the system has prevented more CO2 emissions in winter than summer due to operating at full capacity.

        "abstract": "Although the use of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH,C6H6Cl6) as the pesticide for agricultural purposes is now prohibited in many countries because of its hazardousness, stockpiles of HCH still available today. At this point mechanochemical degradation (MCD) has a remarkable potential for the environmental disposal of some HCH isomers. But the mechanism still needs to be further researched and optimized for better reaction conditions to achieve satisfactory degradation of dominant HCH isomers (α-, β-, γ-, and δ-HCH) together with the reduction of energy consumption and increasing the dechlorination efficiency. While all the previous studies have revealed the effects of operating conditions such as rotational speed, ball size and mass ratios individually, interactions between general parameters have not been determined yet. In the present work, relationships between parameters were investigated, for the first time, using response surface statistical model (RSM) with Box-Behnken Design (BBD) and the operating parameters interactions were optimized on the degradation efficiency of MCD with calcium oxide (CaO) which provides electrons to HCH isomers by planetary ball mill. The experimental results indicated that the best degradation efficiency (%100) was achieved after 480 min. grinding at a charge ratio 1/20 (0,05) HCH/CaO with 1/5 (0,2) mixture/ball mass ratio and a mill rotation speed of 700 rpm. Based on these results, optimization of operating parameters allowed the degradation of dominant HCH isomers effectively and in fast manner. These approaches may also be beneficial for ex situ disposing of other persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by MCD.",

At the first stage, the problem is solved with a set partitioning formulation for two different scenarios where the crew number is minimized, and efficiency is maximized, and different solution alternatives are proposed for the decision maker. Before the problem is modelled, it is purified from the complicated constraint structure and all the possible pairings containing flight legs are created. At the second stage, it is aimed at forming a pairing set which is less affected by delays. In the study based on real data collected from an airline company in Turkey, the past delay values are analyzed, and an average delay value is calculated for each flight leg. With these calculated delay values, propagated delays are modelled. The model, which is formed to choose the best pairing set including all the flight legs, is analyzed with an approach based on bi-criteria optimization. The objectives are combined with the weighted sum method and pairings with optimal cost and less propagated delay are obtained for different weight values. With the proposed methodology, it is observed that the problem can be solved in reasonable operation time.",

        "abstract": "Flexible hinges are joint mechanisms made of soft or flexible materials. The aim of this study is to determine the discharge characteristics of the flexible hinges used in prosthetic hands and fingers according to the production techniques and to determine the most appropriate hinge production parameters. The speed of the opening process and the energy consumption during the closing process directly depend on the structure of the flexible hinge. For this reason, it is important to examine the relationship between the change of the flexible hinge structure and its discharge in terms of oscillation and energy requirement. In the method of the study, primarily flexible hinge samples are produced using different printing parameters. In the next step, a finger-like test system is designed that uses accelerometers to measure discharge oscillations on the fingers. The test mechanism has a body and a free accelerometer. The body sensor is used to distinguish body vibrations transmitted to the free accelerometer. As a result of the measurements made with the test system, it is observed that the honeycomb shape produced higher frequency vibrations than the linear shape in terms of filling the shape. This indicates that the honeycomb filler can store a higher amount of energy as a result of stretching. As the percentage of inner fill or the number of outer shells increased, the frequency of vibration of the flexible hinge when released is found to be higher. It has been concluded that the hinge, which has the highest energy storage capacity at the lowest cost, will have a honeycomb filling shape, 30% filler, and four shells.  Finally, a system that measures the power consumed for finger closing operations is presented. As a result of energy consumption levels with hinges, it has been observed that energy consumption increases as infill density and number of shell values increase. It is seen that these values are compatible with oscillation values. With this system, it is aimed to be used for parameter selection in robotic prosthetic finger application which is planned to be produced by 3D printing in the future.",

The inductive loads consume inductive reactive energy owing to their electrical structures. The consumed reactive energy causes to decrements in power quality and efficiency of the system in addition to power factor deficiencies. The flexible alternating current transmission systems (FACTS) play an important role in improving the performance and quality of the power system. The control of power systems that are equipped with FACTS systems are accomplished more rapidly and easily comparing to regular compensations. The Distribution Static Synchronous Compensator (D-STATCOM) is the most common FACTS device used to increase power quality. D-STATCOM, also used for reactive power control, is a shunt connected device which is used to improve power quality in distribution systems. D-STATCOM exchanges reactive power with mains and prevents voltage fluctuations. In this study, a D-STATCOM that is based on voltage source converter and exchanges reactive power with the distribution line to eliminate power quality problems at the source has been modelled in MATLAB Simulink software and the simulation results were examined. In the modelled system, 4 km distribution line has been modelled with two separate test loads at 16.40kVA (10kW+13kVAR) and 22.36kVA (10kW+20kVAR) rated power, and the D-STATCOM model at the end of the line. The power quality problems caused by these loads on the distribution line were tried to be eliminated through the modelled D-STATCOM. According to the simulation results, it is confirmed that the voltage fluctuation and total harmonic distortion (THD) on the load side are remarkably reduced when the D-STATCOM is connected to the network. As the result, D-STATCOM has been shown to greatly overcome the voltage rise or sags caused by variable loads in the network, to reduce power loss and accordingly improve the voltage stability.",

For this purpose, Oriental beech wood samples were prepared according to ASTM E 160-50 and impregnated with boron compound doped rosin by the method of medium-term dipping (24 hours) according to ASTM D 1413 and producers’ definition. Combustion properties of samples after impregnated process were determined according to ASTM E 160-50. As a part of the research, 6 different combination and contents of impregnation materials have been used in order to especially investigate resistance against combustion of wood material treated with boron compounds in different concentrations. As a result of the study,  retention performance and leaching resistance of boron compounds can be increased through rosin addition. Consequently, impregnation materials with rosin decreased the flame sourced combustion (Fsc) temperatures depending on kind of impregnation material, extended combustion period and decreased weight loss ratio of the test samples in comparison to the control samples. On the contrary, weight loss ratios were affected negatively in Oriental beech test samples up to 3% when compared with samples which were impregnated with borax. Meanwhile, combustion periods increased in test samples up to 30%. Rosin, in terms of its combustion performance, can be preferred in impregnation with boron compounds depending on kind of wood and using area.",

        "abstract": "It is important to develop clustering methods to collect data efficiently in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Among the clustering methods in the literature, the most popular on behalf of balanced energy depletion and increasing the life of the network is heterogeneous clustering consisting of nodes with different characteristics. In this study, Sleep-awake Energy Efficient Distributed (SEED) clustering method that is a heterogeneous clustering, has been improved. In this sense, the mechanism of the SEED has been developed on behalf of the data sending-receiving, and energy consumption. According to the proposed method, the nodes in the WSN perceive the data in specified time periods and do not transmit and receive data by staying asleep at certain times. The most important difference of the proposed algorithm from the SEED method is that the remaining energy of the nodes and the network average energy are added to the threshold value in the cluster head (CH) selection. Moreover, cluster formation and CH selection enables more effective method than SEED algorithm by providing cluster members to communicate with CHs, and then the data transmission process is also included in the method process. Thus, energy consumption is reduced and network life is elongated by choosing the optimum CHs. The proposed method has been compared with both the SEED algorithm and other heterogeneous clustering methods existing in the literature in the simulation environment. The results of the simulations show the advantages of the recommended method.",

        "abstract": "In space hardware development projects, reliability is at the forefront because of environmental conditions, radiation effects and maintenance difficulty. However, low reliability equipment fails and causes satellite loss before completing service life. To eliminate this problem, analyses such as reliability prediction, derating, worst case, Failure Modes, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), at development phase are conducted according to European Space Standardization Cooperation guidance documents. FMECA guided in ECSS-Q-ST-30-02C is the most comprehensive reliability analyses in which potential failures are identified and evaluated. The aim of this study is to introduce a new hybrid FMECA approach by presenting a case study on Power Control Unit (PCU) which is mission critical satellite equipment. PCU performs battery charge/discharge processes and provides power to satellite equipment by conditioning energy from solar panels. If failure modes in FMECA aren’t determined in detail and probability of occurrence isn’t calculated precisely, satellite mission can be lost. Hence, equipment’s electronic boards are divided into hardware blocks and their functions determine failure modes. Failure rates taken from reliability prediction analysis are distributed to electronic boards and small hardware blocks respectively, thus failure modes’ probabilities could be calculated more precisely. Consequently failure modes are analyzed; criticalities are evaluated by performing hybrid FMECA for PCU electronic boards. Hereby, all possible failure modes are examined and their criticality is correctly determined, and possibility of satellite loss result from equipment failure is minimized.",

Then, the main methods of coupling diagnostic and prognostic processes are explained: Watch Dog, Prognostic Enhancements to Diagnosis Systems (PEDS), Integrated Predictive Maintenance Systems (SIMP) and OSA-CBM. This last strategy with its seven specialized layers permits the interoperability of both processes. The monitoring system provides health indicators of PVGs and results are returned to human operator. The annual reduction rate of the CPR and reduction rate (Rd), allows us controlling the proposed coupling framework. This approach is validated with experimental data collected on four photovoltaic installations from the IEA PVPS Task13 database.",

        "abstract": "In this study, effect of waste PET additive on moisture damage resistance of bituminous hot mixtures were investigated. For this purpose, firstly, 2.5% by weight Triethanolamine (TEO/TEOA) chemical was added to pure B 70/100 bitumen to create a chemical bond between bitumen and PET. Then, modified bitumens were obtained by adding waste PET in the ratios of 2%, 4%, 6%, 8% and 10% by weight of bitumen to this bitumen-TEO blend. Modified bitumen samples were subjected to X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) tests to determine the interaction between bitumen and PET. In the second stage of the study, the optimum bitumen content (obc) of the mixture was determined according to Marshall mixture design method using pure bitumen and aggregate. Modified mixture specimens were prepared by keeping this bitumen ratio constant in order to compare it with pure (control) mixture results. The mixture specimens prepared were subjected to Marshall stability and flow, retained Marshall stability (RMS) and indirect tensile strength (ITS) tests.  According to the test results, it was observed that bitumen tends to harden with the addition of waste PET and a good chemical interaction occurs between bitumen and PET. In addition, it was observed that the waste PET additive did not have a serious effect on the Marshall stability and flow value of the mixtures, but increased the moisture damage resistance of the mixtures by generating significant increases in RMS and indirect tensile strength ratio (ITSR) values.",

The threedifferent modified wings and the baseline obtained were compared in terms ofaerodynamic performance. The wavelength of the modified wings used in thisstudy is 16% of the chord length and the values of the amplitudes weredetermined as 0,05%, 0,1% and 0,15%, respectively, of the chord length. Allwing structures were designed in Solidworks CAD program. These solid modelswere numerically analyzed with the k-epsilon realizable turbulence model in theaverage Navier-Stokes analysis method in ANSYS Fluent software. Wing opennessratio (aspect ratio) value 1,1 was selected. On the 7,2x105Reynoldsnumber, analyzes were made on the wing at the attack angle between 0 ° and 46°. After the examination of the results, it’s found that the baseline has ahigher lift coefficient (CL) than the modified wing before thestall. The coefficient of friction (CD) of the 0,05a0,16w (0,05a ve0,16w) is 12,57% lower than that of the baseline. For post-stall angle ofattacks, when 0,05a0,16w wing is compared to baseline average CLandCDvalue, the wing of 0,5a0,16w has 7,86% and 9,79% higher valuesrespectively.

One of the most important factors affecting thepower quality is the harmonics resulting from non-linear loads in the system.In recent years, the development of the power electronics causes non-linearloads to increase. Correspondingly, it causes waveform distortions andharmonics in power systems. Harmonics cause technical and economical losses inthe system. Except for some precaution to take in the design phase of a powersystem, the most important method for reducing harmonics is the use of harmonicfilters. In this study, harmonic measurements of fluorescent lamp withelectronic ballast are taken. Thereafter, passive filters are designed toreduce harmonics, their effects and decreases in Total Harmonics Distortion(THD) values are observed. Single-tuned and double-tuned models are used infilter design. The same system is modeled in Matlab/Simulink, the theoreticalresults are compared with measurement results.",

For thispurpose, a liquid type flat PV/T collector system which is suitable for hotwater supply and electrical power production is used. Various parameters suchas sealing factor, radiation, inlet temperature, ambient temperature, absorbentplate parameters (tube spacing, pipe diameter, flap thickness, etc.) and thethermal conductivity of the fluid in the absorbent plate must be taken intoconsideration for such systems to operate withmaximum efficiency. The thermal efficiency of the PV/T collectors issignificantly influenced by the ratio of the temperature difference between theinlet temperature and the ambient temperature (Ti-Ta) to the global solar radiation(G) falling on the collector surface. (Ti-Ta) / G ratio increase decreases thethermal efficiency. In addition, other factors affecting thermal efficiency arethe sealing factor (s) and the different flap ratio (d/w) values. The increaseof the d/w ratio also increases the collector area and decreases the PV moduletemperature, thus increasing the electrical efficiency. The major problem inPV/T systems is that optimum efficiency can be achieved by considering allthese parameters.In this study, aMATLAB/Simulink model of PV/T collector was prepared by using mathematicalequations. With the help of this model, the design parameters and their effectsto thermal and electrical efficiency were investigated. The maximum thermalefficiency, electrical efficiency and total efficiency of the PV/T collectorwere determined as 64.5%, 13.5% and 78%, respectively.",

The numerical models weredeveloped using the explicit finite element module of ANSYS. 50 caliber projectilewith an initial velocity of 400 m/s is used during the analyses. In the firstpart of the study, 7075, 6061 and 2024 aluminum alloys are compared for theirballistic impact resistance. Amount of perforation energies (energy absorbingcapacity of target) and projectile residual velocities of these alloys arecompared. Also, thicknesses of plates are increased up to the point at whichthe plates don't exhibit full perforations for the used projectile and initialvelocity. It is seen that that residual velocity of the Al 7075 T6 is thesmallest among the used aluminum alloys which means that 7075 T6 type ofaluminum has the higher ballistic impact resistance. In the second part of thestudy, six different hybrid models that have different combinations of Al 7075and Kevlar29/Epoxy are proposed. Perforation energies and projectile residualvelocities of these proposed models are compared under ballistic impactloadings. It was shown that the hybrid model with 6AL-6KEV orientation, was theoptimum structure to resist the ballistic impact loading among the proposedmodels.

However, it is susceptible tobiodegradation due to its hygroscopic nature and chemical composition thatlimits both its indoor and outdoor usage. Boron compounds which are known aseco-friendly wood preservatives have limited utility at outdoor conditionssince they are easily leached out from wood by water. The aim of this study isto prevent boron leaching by creating a polymer network that encapsulates boroncompound inside the wood cell walls, thus decay resistance, dimensionalstability and water repellence are improved. In the study, Siberian pinesamples were impregnated with 1% boric acid in DMF(N,N-Dimethylformamide) andfurther ε-caprolactone monomer (1% SnOct2 as initiator) mixture for furtherin-situ polymerization were carried out in the oven at 150°C for 3 hours. Priorto decay testing, leaching test was conducted in order to evaluate any loss ineffectiveness in decay resistance against to C. puteana and C. versicolorattack due to possibility of boron leaching from wood. The results showed thatleached samples had lower weight loss than unleached samples after C. puteanaattack, however, the weight loss by C. versicolor attack increased in leached samples.Decay resistance of treated samples was found to be 7-99% in comparison withreferences. Boric acid and polymer combination increased dimensional stability(25% ASE), and water repellence (15%) of wood compared to references withoutdeformation. This method showed that curing may be an alternative for woodmodification with in-situ polycaprolactone polymerization in order to usehazardous solvent media for polymerization.",

In this case, if the selected indoor ambient referencetemperature is above or below 1-11 °C, the increase or decrease in the energydemand is calculated proportionally. In addition, considering the lastthirty-two year period in the city, the change of HDH value according to years andthe amount of global warming have been determined. This study is thought thatusers of heating systems in Düzce will be aware of the energy consumption forheating and global warming caused by environmental air pollution and will helpacademicians working in this field with industrialists producing heatingsystems.",

        "abstract": "There are many different type of solar energy systems, which are being used widely for different applications. The most important element of these solar systems is solar collector. There are four main types: Flat Panel (FPSC), Evacuated Tube, Heat Pipe and Parabolic. The most popular type is FP, which was invented in 1950s and this type is predominantly used for last three decades not only in residential but also industrial areas. This is because of two main factors: low initial investment and easy usage. Efficiency of FPSCs are mainly effected by 3 parameters: working fluid thermal conductivity, heat losses and optical losses. Due to low efficiency of FPSCs, Evacuated Tubular Heat Pipe Solar Collectors (ETSCs) are now being studied to replace FPSCs. In this type of solar collectors, optical and thermal losses are minimized and performance of the system is better. In this study, ETSCs which are tested by charging Nano fluid were studied and these researches are very limited in the literature. Last studies proved that Nano fluids are increasing thermal efficiency especially in heat pipes. The outcomes from this study shows that using Nano fluids in ETSCs provides following benefits: Low thermal resistance, high thermal conductivity, higher working temperatures, acceleration in reaching working temperature and improvement in efficiency.",

Finite element (FE) analyses of thesuspension system was also carried out via ANSYS®Workbenchapplication for predicted loads on the wheel contact point which representvarious load conditions. Results showed that the final design satisfies thesafety condition for three times the design load.

The vertical loads transferred from the foundation can causefailure and/or extreme settlements in the soft/loose soil. Additionalgeotechnical precautions must be taken in order to prevent such problems.Construction of piles under foundations is a widely used method. Piles aredefined as point bearing piles or friction piles depending on the embeddedlength of the pile in the stiff layer or rock. Generally it is preferred toconstruct pile groups under the foundations to reduce the effects ofdifferential settlements and eccentricity. The interaction of a pile with theothers in a group is defined as “group efficiency” and this interaction causesreduction in the load-bearing capacities of the piles. It is necessary tocalculate the bearing capacity of a single pile correctly and estimate theoptimum number of piles in the group to make a safe and economical design. Inthis paper, it is aimed to investigate the robustness of Grey Wolf optimizationalgorithm for optimization problems of pile groups under vertical loads.  In order to compare the validity of Grey WolfOptimization algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm and ImprovedHarmony Search algorithm are used. The proposed methods are intended to helpengineers to make fast, safe and economical designs for pile groups.

In addition, after the disaster, people's needs such as food, shelter and cleaning should be met quickly and regularly. In order to meet the needs of people in disasters that cause great damage such as earthquakes and make many places unusable, the temporary warehouse should be located. Therefore, the locations of the temporary storage should be determined using appropriate analytical methods before an earthquake occurs. Kırıkkale is a city with high probability of earthquakes due to its distance to fault zones. This, as well as production facilities are located within the boundaries of Turkey's major strategic industry. The fact that 43 provinces are the intersection point, especially its proximity to Ankara and the large industrial establishments located between Ankara increase the importance of the temporary warehouse to be located in Kırıkkale in a possible earthquake outside Kırıkkale. In this study, the problem of temporary warehouse location selection in Kırıkkale province has been addressed in 3 stages. In the first stage, four alternative districts were compared, in the second stage, six alternative locations were compared by using multi-criteria decision-making methods. After determining the location of the temporary warehouse, in the third stage, the routes through which the food distribution will be distributed were determined with four different scenarios. In this study, a integrated approach for warehouse location selection and distribution planning is proposed to the literature.",

After the industrial revolution, replacing simple machines with steam engines started the adventure of energy dependence and gave strategic energy importance. This situation has played a critical role in reshaping human history. In addition, due to the limited fossil energy resources and the continuous increase in energy costs, countries have started to develop new energy policies for their interests. Thus, scientists have accelerated their work in the field of energy efficiency. District heating systems, one of the best examples of renewable energy use, are the main subject of this study. District heating can be defined as the heating of a building, neighborhood, or city with power plants installed in one or more centers. This study aims to calculate the financial benefit of the district heating systems to be created with the use of geothermal resources in Türkiye to the Türkiye economy and its contribution to the goals of carbon neutrality. As a result of the use of a geothermal-sourced district heating system, a 1.58% reduction will be achieved in Türkiye's annual greenhouse gas emissions. With current investment amounts, the amortization period of 1,000,000 residential equivalent geothermal sourced district heating system implementation is approximately 13 years.

The mass losses of each kiwi slices in 100 g mass were measured every two hours in the experiment lasting 14 hours in total and moisture ratios (MR) were calculated as well. Considering the experimental results, 8 different kinetics drying models were performed using MATLAB software. As a result, the lowest reduced chi-square (X2) values for 5 mm and 7 mm thicknesses were calculated about 8.261x10-6 and 1.705x10-5 respectively, the root means square error values (RMSE) were about 0.002865 and 0.004146, respectively. Also, the coefficient of determination (R2) for both thicknesses was calculated as 0.9999 which was the highest result closest to 1. Among the 8 different kinetic drying models, the Logarithmic model was chosen as a proper kinetic drying model for kiwi products. When the moisture contents and drying rates were considered it was seen that the drying rate of kiwi slices with 7 mm thickness exhibited slow behavior because of the higher moisture content. Besides, it was determined that the effective diffusivity coefficients for specimens with 5 mm and 7 mm thickness were calculated as 2.25 × 10-10 m2/s and 3.28 × 10-10 m2/s respectively.",

The mixing ratio of the nanoparticles in the hybrid structure was 1:1, and the particle mass fraction in 100 ml of mineral oil (MO) was also set at 1.0%. When comparing the thermophysical properties of mono and hybrid nanolubricants, it was found that the performance of the hybrid structures was better for cooling systems.",

        "abstract": "At the end of 2019, Covid-19, which is a new form of Coronavirus, has spread widely all over the world. With the increasing daily cases of this disease, fast, reliable, and automatic detection systems have been more crucial. Therefore, this study proposes a new technique that combines the machine learning algorithm of Adaboost with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify Chest X-Ray images. Basic CNN algorithm and pretrained ResNet-152 have been used separately to obtain features of the Adaboost algorithm from Chest X-Ray images. Several learning rates and the number of estimators have been used to compare these two different feature extraction methods on the Adaboost algorithm. These techniques have been applied to the dataset, which contains Chest X-Ray images labeled as Normal, Viral Pneumonia, and Covid-19. Since the used dataset is unbalanced between classes SMOTE method has been used to make the number of images of classes balance. This study shows that proposed CNN  as a feature extractor on the Adaboost algorithm(learning rate of 0.1 and 25 estimators)  provides higher classification performance with 94.5% accuracy, 93% precision, 94% recall, and 93% F1-score.",

The important thing here is to ensure that the grid integration effects are within the standards. In this way, serious problems in the grid are prevented. For this reason, it is very important to investigate the effects of grid integration and to carry out studies to reduce these effects in advance. However, there are limited studies in the literature to examine the effects of grid integration and to reduce these effects. For this purpose ın study, a wind turbine system with a 3 MVA permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected to the grid is modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC. With the help of the created model, the variable nature of the wind, the integration of wind power plants into the grid are examined and the amount of power transferred from the wind farm to the grid under different load conditions is presented. In addition, the negative effects of the intermittent and variable nature of the wind on the network were analyzed and in order to reduce these effects, the voltage regulation process was carried out on the DC line, which ensures the controlled operation of the inverter.",

Specifically, machine learning algorithms are used for making accurate predictions about the future directions of the professions which consequently will influence professional development of labour force. The aim of this study is to investigate the professions of the future and current in Turkey by the application of supervised learning algorithms and clustering methods to various Turkish data including documents belonging to Turkey's institutions. In this study, the popular professions were predicted with an accuracy rate between ≅0.81 and ≅0.93 thorough various machine learning algorithms. It was discovered that methodologically perceptron and stochastic gradient descent algorithms demonstrated superiority over other algorithms thanks to their intelligence functions. Furthermore, the analysis of current professions in Turkey revealed that the class of \"Professional occupations\", \"Managers\" and \"Technicians and assistant professional members\" were popular, and according to the analysis of the future, information technology-based occupations will be important. Although limited Turkish data sources for the analysis of future, results with an accuracy of nearly 1 were produced.",

Within this period, the risk of contamination in closed areas has drawn attention especially to the air conditioning systems in these areas. In the current situation, the best weapons we have against the virus are mask, physical distance, and hygiene. However, it is possible to reduce the risk of contamination with ventilation and air conditioning systems in closed areas. Considering the size of the virus, filtration and the use of UV-C lamps and increasing the fresh air flow in the indoor area have shown that the risk of transmission of the virus is significantly reduced. Hospitals are the buildings where the virus load is the most intense by its nature. Although the spaces in the hospital have a central air conditioning system, some measures should be taken within this period and these devices, which were designed without considering pandemic scenarios, should be operated in a way to minimize the risk of contamination. Especially temporary solutions for negative pressure rooms, how to provide pressurization in intensive care units, measures that can be taken in air handling units, issues to be considered in the HVAC system, etc. many measures are discussed in this study. In addition, the design details of how the exhaust vent can be taken behind the patient's head when necessary in an intensive care unit that is planned to be operated according to the pandemic scenario are discussed. A demonstration of the Covid-19 infection risk calculation tool with examples in a closed area is also given. The points to be considered in the application of UV-C systems are specified.",

Although the effective section stiffness of the cracked section is not constant, it depends on parameters such as the concrete strength and reinforcement ratio. In this study, RC beam models with different concrete strength, tensile and compression reinforcement ratios were designed to investigate nonlinear moment-curvature relationships and effective stiffness coefficients. Analytically investigated parameters were calculated from TBEC (2018), ACI318 (2014), ASCE/SEI41 (2017), Eurocode2 (2004) and Eurocode8 (2004, 2005) regulations and moment-curvature relationships. The effective section stiffness coefficient obtained from the analyses were compared with the effective section stiffness coefficient given for RC members in different regulations. The results obtained at the end were examined by comparing them according to different parameters and models. For constant concrete strength and tensile reinforcement ratio in RC beams, with increasing compression reinforcement ratio, effective stiffness coefficient values increase. In RC beams with constant compression and tensile strength ratio, effective stiffness coefficient values increase with increasing concrete strength. The compression reinforcement ratio has been proved to be effective on the maximum moment bearing capacity of the RC beams, effective flexural stiffness and effective stiffness coefficient and ductility of the sections.",

Scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM) analyzes were carried out in order to understand the morphological and dimensional properties of the catalysts, and hydrolysis tests were performed to determine hydrogen production capacities and kinetic data. Two and three component catalysts Co0.95Fe0.05/Al2O3 and Co0.85Fe0.08Pt0.07/Al2O3 showed the best performance in their groups. With 40 mg Co0.85Fe0.08Pt0.07/Al2O3 catalyst, hydrogen production rate of 12,750 mL H2/gkat.min was reached at 20 ˚C. By differentiating the amount of NaBH4 and catalyst, it was observed that the hydrogen generation is proportional to the amount of catalyst, and the order of reaction with rescept to NaBH4 is 0,22. The activation energy of the high activity Co0.85Fe0.08Pt0.07/Al2O3 catalyst was calculated as 26.17 kJ/mol.

These problems, which emerged with the COVID-19 pandemic, have become a subject that attracts the attention of researchers. In order for the world to cope with this epidemic more quickly, it is important to ensure community immunity by vaccinating the population both in our country and in the world. With the increase in the supply of vaccines, new problems arise such as determining the capacities of hospitals where vaccines will be administered, choosing hospitals where vaccines can be administered, and determining routes to distribute vaccines to hospitals. Vehicle routing problem first started to take its place in the literature in the 1950s, and today it is seen as an open problem area that can be adapted  for the new problem under different assumptions. In this study, a mathematical model has been proposed in order to ensure that vaccines are transported from a distribution center to the hospitals where they will be administered, as soon as possible and at minimum cost. For this problem, a new mathematical model has been proposed by using the vehicle routing problem models in the literature. In order to test the effectiveness of the developed model, an application example was made for the province of Ankara and the problem was solved in the GAMS 24.3.1 program. By evaluating the results obtained in the solution of the problem, the minimum cost routes of the vehicles to visit the hospitals were determined.",

Six different fiber types were used in granular road layer by using different methods. Firstly, fibers were added in the road as a layer, then they mixed with soil particles, and as a third method they mixed with soil by laying a geotextile in the road layer, in other words it was used as combine reinforced model. And as the last method only a geotextile was laid and used in the pavement soil. By using these methods, the influence of different type of reinforcements on CBR and bearing capacity ratio values were investigated. Additionally, effects on the pavement layer thickness were calculated and for the best configuration of fiber reinforced sample a cost analysis was conducted. As a result of the study, CBR test values for each fiber type used in the study have different values, and for small penetration levels some test results show no improvement for bearing capacity ratio of the road. It was noticed that when increasing the penetration level, the bearing capacity ratios have larger values. Thus, cost and layer thickness numbers were various for different reinforced road layer models. Therefore, in the real life road projects before using fiber types, cost and performance analysis should be made to determine the more effective one.",

This complex structure, which is immanent to social reality and nature itself, requires hydrogen technologies research to be handled with an interdisciplinary approach. Therefore, the study aims to determine the role and contribution of social science fields in this interdisciplinary structure of hydrogen technologies research. For this purpose, 379 articles indexed in the Web of Science (WoS) Social Sciences Citation Index between 1975-2021 in the field of hydrogen technologies research were analyzed with the help of related keywords. According to findings, the number of publications and citations in the field of hydrogen technologies research has been increasing rapidly in the last 10 years. The fact that more than half of the publications have more than one author shows that the interaction and cooperation between the co-authors in this field are intense. Studies in the field of hydrogen technologies are gathered in five thematic clusters named as “Technical and Systemic Context”, “Hydrogen as an Energy carrier”, “Political Background”, “Transportation and Behavioral Factors” and “Infrastructure and Design”, combining these clusters into a holistic socio-technical system. Keyword analysis shows that as time passes, the social dimensions and effects of research in the field are examined in more detail.

The produced active carbon was modified with 4 different chemical catalysts (ZnCl2, H3PO4, H2SO4 ve KOH) and the effect of the activation process on the adsorption efficiency was investigated. Adsorption experiments were studied in a batch system and the effects of parameters such as initial dye concentration, contact time, pH and temperature on the adsorption process were investigated. Maximum dye removal was observed at pH=3.0. Rhodamine B adsorption decreased with increasing initial dye concentration. With increasing contact time, the removal efficiency of Rhodamine B increased and equilibrium was reached in about 30 minutes. The highest dye removal efficiency (49.71%) was obtained as a result of activation of activated carbon with KOH. Experimental results were examined in terms of their suitability to the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models. According to the correlation coefficients, the Langmuir isotherm model was found to be more suitable for the experimental data obtained in this study. The adsorption mechanism has been explained with the thermodynamic parameters calculated. Accordingly, the obtained positive ∆G values showed that the adsorption process was not spontaneous, and the positive ∆H and ∆S values showed that the adsorption process was endothermic and random.",

In this study, firstly, the synthesis parameters of phenyl fluoroborate, one of the special boron compounds were determined and then the usability of the obtained pigment in paint and its antibacterial properties were tested with the disc method. Phenol and fluoroboric acid were used as reactants in the synthesis of phenyl fluoroborate by wet method and H2SO4 was preferred as catalyst.

FT-IR and BF4- ion selective electrodes were used for characterization studies. Phenyl fluoroborate was synthesized with 62% yield at a mole ratio of reactants of 2:1, 35 °C and 90 minutes. The pigment was converted into a solvent-based antifouling paint with an epoxy type binder and kept its paint form when immersed in sea water. Antibacterial activity was investigated using the agar disc diffusion method, and while the antibacterial property due to diffusion was not observed in the paint sample, the phenyl fluoroborate pigment showed antibacterial property.",

In addition, the surface morphologies of the film samples were examined by SEM. It has been observed that AESO/SCK films have antibacterial properties. In addition, the swelling ratio of AESO/SCK composite films was found to be between 0.2433% and 4.6343%. The water solubility rate of AESO was determined as 0.1103% by weight. This ratio increased as the SCK ratio increased and reached 0.7380% with a 50% SCK ratio. The water content of AESO/SCK composite films was in the range of 0.660-2.1203%.

The total weight of the bar elements that make up the whole structure is used as the objective function. The size of the bars in the span and the heights of the vertical bars are assigned as design variables. The minimum natural vibration frequencies of the rods as compressive and tensile strength, buckling resistance and dynamic restraint are limited or defined within certain ranges. The constraints are included as logarithmic barrier functions. Some important results of this study are that with an increase in the number of gaps, the final optimum structure becomes slightly heavier, the shape of the optimum structure shows a curve close to a parabola, and the optimum structure becomes more rigid in the vertical direction when dynamic constraints are included in the process.",

There are many ISPs in the world and in our country, and there is an intense competition between ISPs due to the rapid developments in the electronic communication sector. In this case, users are faced with ISP selection problem. Considering all qualitative and quantitative criteria that meet the needs of the user, the choice of ISP that will provide the best service can be designed as a Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem with uncertainty. In this study, fuzzy set theory is used to model uncertainty. In the study, the ISP selection process of home users who want to get fiber technology service is made in two stages. In the first stage, the criteria that affect the users’ ISP selection are determined and the weights of these criteria are calculated using Fuzzy Rank Sum (FRS), Fuzzy Rank Reciprocal (FRR) and Fuzzy Rank Order Centroid (FROC). In the second stage, ISP alternatives that provide fiber technology services for the same users are listed by fuzzy MARCOS method, taking into account the criteria determined in the first stage. In this way, the fuzzy MARCOS method is evaluated together with different fuzzy rank ordering weighting methods and a comparative analysis is made and the results are interpreted.",

They are produced in the same nominal diameter but in different lengths. There are usually two cooling holes, one behind the central insert and the other behind the peripheral insert. However, in some Udrills, an extra third cooling hole is drilled by the manufacturer. In this study, the effects of different length/diameter ratios, extra coolant hole and drilling parameters on thrust force, torque and spindle load were investigated in order to determine the effect of differences in U drills on hole drilling. AA 2024-T351 was drilled to a depth of 40mm using Udrills with a body diameter of 20mm. A total of 4 Udrills (3D, 4D, 4De, 5D) were used. Three feed rates (0.06, 0.09, 0.12mm/rev) and three cutting speeds (200, 250, 300m/min) were used in the experiments. According to the Anova analysis, it was concluded that while the length/diameter ratio of Udrills had an effect of 56.97% on thrust force and 21.46% on spindle load, it was not effective for torque. The 4De Udrill with extra coolant hole gave 34.2% higher thrust force, 0.3% higher torque value and 26.53% lower spindle load compared to the 4D Udrill without extra coolant hole.",

The  equipment can measure the SO2, CO2, CO, CH4, NOX, O3, PM2.5, and VOC pollution alongside with many atmospheric parameters. The measurement period has been decided to be one year starting from June 2021. The measurement period was one year, starting from June 2021. The measurements were taken at fifty points with 8 portable intermittent equipment.  Then hourly and monthly averages were calculated. The calculation of the averages depends on many statistical analyses. The mean (geometric, harmonic, root, interquartile, Winsorized), median, midrange, Skewness, and Kurtosis analyses were done to obtain correct daily, and monthly averages. These analyses are necessary to comment on the intermittent measurement averages. The analyses of the collected data showed that the concentrations are changing considerably through the measurement period. The highest concentration was observed for the SO2, CO, NOX, and PM2.5 with respective values of 186.4, 170, 204.9, and 265 µg/m3. All these values are dangerous for human health. Elevation, temperatures, atmospheric pressure, and wind are sensitive parameters for atmospheric pollution. In Karabük province, most of the measurement points are affected by multi-pollution sources. The scatter diagrams also support this fact. During winter months, the pollution increases instantly. However, O3 and VOC parameters show different trends as compared to other pollutants. The concentration of these two parameters, namely O3 and VOC, increases during spring months. The O3 and VOC increase by 78.1%, and 43.2%, respectively due to photochemical reactions in the atmosphere in spring.",

Emotion recognition is an example of difficult classification due to factors such as ambient light, age, race, gender, and facial position. In this article, a 3-stage system is proposed for emotion detection from facial images. In the first stage, the CNN-based network is trained with the Fer+ dataset. The Binary Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is applied for feature selection to the feature vector in the fully connected layer of the CNN network trained in the second stage. Selected features are classified by Support Vector Machine. The performance of the proposed system has been tested with the Fer+ dataset. As a result of the test, 85.74% accuracy was measured. The results show that the combination of BPSO and SVM contributes to the classification accuracy and speed of the FER+ dataset.",

The weights of the canlica mushrooms were measured every two hours and MR (Moisture rates) were calculated. According to our results, the lowest chi-square (X2) was 1.851 x10-4 and the estimated standard error (RMSE) value was 0.01358. The correlation value (R2) was calculated as 0.9988, close to one. The best Page model gave these results from the kinetic models. The effective diffusivity for the Kanlıca Mushroom with 5 mm thicknesses can be calculated at about 3.2035×10-10 m2/s. It was confirmed that the calculated effective diffusivity value was within the reference range mentioned in the literature (10-12  m2/s – 10-8 m2/s) for food products.",

For the present study, blends containing electron donor and acceptor are used instead of materials made with silicon.  Carbon-based organic semiconductors are easy to process and have low fabrication costs. There are several fabrication steps playing important role in the photovoltaic device performance such as, substrate preparation, polymer-acceptor ratios in the blend, thermal annealing of the active layer and top electrode deposition. It has been shown that nanoscale morphology of the blend can be altered via thermal annealing treatment. As a result, efficiency is affected by surface roughness. The blend of P3HT: PCBM as donor: acceptor was used to fabricate thin films and photovoltaic cells. The power conversion efficiencies and surface morphologies of the devices annealed at various times were measured. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images revealed that the surface roughness of the active layer is mainly affected by the annealing time, and the film with the roughest surface results in the most efficient solar cell.",

Gamma radiation from 60Co was used to create paramagnetic defects in MOMTPPC single crystal. EPR spectra of MOMTPPC single crystals were obtained at 120 K temperature by rotating around three orthogonal axes. The structure of the radical formed by the irradiation effect in MOMTPPC was found by detailed examination of the EPR spectra. With the effect of radiation, the C20-H24 bond was broken and a paramagnetic center was formed. It has been determined that the unpaired electron of the radical formed as a result of the breaking of the chemical bond is located mainly on the C20 atom. The anisotropic g-factor and hyperfine coupling constants of the radiation damage center were determined. While the isotropic value of the spectroscopic splitting factor is obtained as g = 2.00764, the isotropic values of the hyperfine structure constants are 〖(a_H)〗_α = 2.010  mT, 〖(a_P)〗_β = 3.196  mT and 〖(a_(C_6 H_5 ))〗_γ= 〖(a_fenil)〗_γ = 0.472 mT.

In the experimental study, two different evaporation temperatures (4°C, +4°C) and two different condenser temperatures (30°C, 50°C) cases were investigated. The power consumption of R404A was determined to be greater compared to R454C for both condenser temperatures. Moreover, COP of R454C was seen to be higher than R404A about by 10%. The mass flow rate of refrigerant circulating in the system was reduced using R454C. The power consumption of R454C was about 15% lower than R404A. Although the discharge temperature of compressor for the alternative refrigerant was greater than R404A, R454C is verified to be suitable for the operating conditions. TEWI computations indicates that CO2 emissions are reduced substantially using R454C. The exergy efficiency of R454C was found to be approximately 10-15% higher than R404A.

Eppler 423 airfoil is widely used in wind turbine blades, wings of gliders and R/C airplanes designed for sport flying and competitions thanks to high lift capability. NACA 6409 airfoil is seen in free-flight model planes. In literature review, it has been found that k-ω SST, k-kl-ω and 𝛾-𝑅𝑒𝜃 transition models have a good prediction in Cl-Cd estimation of drag bucket region, transition flow regime, and laminar separation point. In addition to RANS models, laminar model was also investigated. In order to ensure the accuracy and precision of numerical investigations; the grid sensitivity study and near wall model were used. The method of decomposition of flow direction vector procedure has been used to provide the advantage of simulating all angle of attacks using only a single mesh. The lift coefficient curves and polar diagrams were formed from the angle of attack of -4 degree up to the stall. Experimental data, XFoil analysis data and numerical analysis data were evaluated in terms of best glide ratio-(Cl/Cd)max and minimum sink-(Cl1.5/Cd)max criteria. As expected, at high angle of attack, the transition ramp on the upper surface moves forward and the pressure gradient became more adverse. The results showed that fine mesh gives better results than other mesh sizes and transitional γ-Reθ SST model was successful in modelling the transition event than other turbulence models.",

Isolation of pandemic species is of great importance for the development of appropriate treatment protocols in emerging viral infections. For this, it is necessary to develop existing methods as well as new methods. Viruses do not exist in living form in nature and they need other creatures to transfer their genetic material. In this respect, water resources and air appear as the most important means of transmission. Adsorption processes for the transmission means can be applied to prevent the spread of viruses and to inactivate them. In this review, the interactions of viruses with various adsorbents containing carbonaceous, oxidized, porous anf metal organic framework materials were examined. Electrostatic interactions were found to be more effective in target types of adsorbing processes of adsorbents used in water and air purification. Since the virus surface carries various organic functional groups, it is seen that it will interact with different adsorbents electrostatic and in this way they can be removed and both isolated and rendered ineffective. We think that our study will contribute to effective solutions to prevent the spread of other pathogens, including coronaviruses, by adsorption processes to be applied to air and water sources and to disinfect the specified transmission means.",

In this study, the effects of using soybean oil methyl ester as a fuel in a direct injected diesel engine on the performance and exhaust emissions were investigated experimentally. Experimental study was performed using diesel fuel no.2 and soybean oil methyl ester at full load and engine speeds ranging from 1200 to 2400 rpm. The results showed that the biodiesel produced lower effective power and higher specific fuel consumption than diesel fuel due to lower heating value of soybean oil methyl ester. In addition, CO, HC, NOx and smoke emissions from biodiesel were lower than that of diesel fuel no.2",

Thespeciment were tempered at 4270C, 3160C, 2040C for 40 minutes, consequently reaching the hardness of 40, 45, 50 HRCrespectively. Residual stresses in heat treated specimens were determined by the layer removal method. As a result of theexperiments, the tensile residual stress on the surface of not heat-treated specimen (12 HRC) was 211 MPa. On the other hand,the tensile residual stress on the surface of heat-treated ones with 40, 45, 50 HRC hardness values, were found as 169, 299, 203MPa respectively. Finally, this study has shown that the residual tensile stresses on the surface of the material were due tohardening and the values of the residual stresses are affected by the hardness amount of materials",

Water on the hot fluid side, 0:100%, 40:60%, 60:40% and 100:0% on the cold fluid side, into different ratios of EG-water at 0%, 2%, 4%, 6% nanoparticles volume fractions and different Reynolds numbers (6000 – 8000 – 12000 – 16000 - 20000) nanofluids obtained by adding Al2O3 and SiO2 nanoparticles were used. According to the results of numerical studies, when the fixed volumetric flow value of hot fluid water is 3 l/min, the constant volumetric flow value of nanofluids is 0.9 l/min and Reynolds number 20000, Al2O3-100:0% EG/water and SiO2-100:0% EG/water. The Nusselt number of nanofluids increased by 15.4% and 9.1%, respectively, compared to 0:100% EG/water. The results showed that the pressure drop in a counter flow tubular heat exchanger is high, as well as the heat exchanger performance is better than the parallel flow, the Nusselt number increases with the solid volume concentration contained in the nanofluid, and both the 0:100% ratio and the SiO2 of the Al2O3-100:0% EG/water nanofluid. SiO2 -100:0% EG/water indicates that it is more effective in increasing the performance of the heat exchanger compared to nanofluid.",

        "abstract": "FM controlled ZVS LLC resonant converter operates with low switching losses at high switching frequencies for a wide input voltage range. To obtain a constant output voltage against varying input voltage and load, the DC voltage gain of the converter, hence its operating intervals, needs to be changed. In different operating intervals, many operating parameters change besides the DC voltage gain of the converter. In this study, ZVS operating intervals of the converter are compared in terms of efficiency, switch stresses, and soft switching for constant output voltage against varying input voltage and load. The prototype circuit of the converter with the input voltage range of 80-120 V, nominal input voltage of 100 V, and output voltage of 8 V is established. The measurement results obtained from the prototype circuit for much different input voltage and load values are presented comparatively. The effect of different ZVS operating intervals on the operating parameters of the converter is revealed in many ways. Moreover, it is observed that the operating performance of the converter around series resonance frequency is better than the operating frequencies far from this frequency value.",

Due to the multitude and complexity of these stages, fabric defects can frequently occur. With the modern fabric production process being nearly fully automated, and given the variety of potential defects, detecting errors on fabrics has become increasingly challenging. The rapid pace of production and the substantial market share of the sector mean that relying on human inspection for error detection can lead to significant time losses and can reduce the accuracy of defect detection to around 60%. Consequently, recent years have seen a shift towards the development of intelligent systems for fabric defect detection in parallel with technological advancements. With the rapid progression of artificial intelligence, the application of image processing techniques has commenced in this field. This study has developed a real-time defect detection system for fabrics using deep learning techniques. Initially, a network model was created using an open-source neural network library, CNN, achieving 89% accuracy. Subsequent implementations using the VGG16 and InceptionV3 architectures reached accuracies of 89% and 86%, respectively. To further improve the study, fabrics were classified into two categories: defective and non-defective, and the pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks model ResNet50-v2 was employed as a feature extractor. This approach yielded an approximate accuracy of 95%.",

The properties such as unit volume weight, compressive strength, water absorption ratio, ultra sound transmission rate and thermal conductivity coefficients of the produced foam concrete samples were investigated.

To this end, we proposed injecting Gaussian noise into the images in the used datasets gradually to see how the performance of that models can be affected by the proportion of the noise in the image. Afterward, three different case studies have been conducted for evaluating the performance of six different well-known pre-trained models namely MobileNet, ResNet, GoogleNet, EfficientNet, VGG19, and Xception. In the first case study, it has been proposed to train these models using a high-quality image dataset and test them using the same datasets after injecting their images with different levels of Gaussian noise. In the second case study, we proposed training the models using the created noisy image datasets in order to investigate how the training process can be affected by the noises in the environment. In the third case study, we proposed using the non-local means algorithm to denoise the images in the noisy datasets and testing the models trained using the original datasets using these de-noised image datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the effects of noise on well-known pre-trained CNN architectures have been comprehensively investigated with this number of considered models.  The obtained results showed that while these types of models can work very well in ideal environments their performances can drop down due to the conditions of the working environment, which reflects the need for some auxiliary models that should be used as a pre-processing phase to improve the performance of these models.",

One of the popular methods applied to increase the efficiency of the signaling system is the green wave application, which means the coordinated operation of the signaling systems. The green wave system prevents vehicles from being repeatedly caught in red light, reducing travel time, waiting time on the roads and carbon emissions of vehicles. The problem that will arise at this point is on which intersection points the green wave system will be applied. In this study, vehicle counting and signaling data of the city of Malatya were used and the transportation network data was converted into a weighted graph. By applying the walktrap community detection algorithm to the transportation network, the intersection points are grouped according to the vehicle transition similarities on them. It was applied to the green wave system physically for the intersection points in 2 different groups determined. The results show that there are significant increases in the number of vehicles passing per unit time in the regions where green waves are applied. This situation has resulted in a decrease in the number of vehicles waiting at red lights and significant reductions in carbon emissions from stationary vehicles into the atmosphere.",

The main reason for this behavior is the increased base pressure due to earthquake load and the excess of soil bearing capacity and elastic bearing coefficient. It was understood that the buildings were overturned due to the increased top displacements and second order base moments due to different settlements in the soil. In this study, overturning analysis of overturned 4 buildings in the city center of Adapazarı after the August 17th, 1999 Kocaeli earthquake with different height/width ratios (H/B) ratios, were made using the ETABS 18.1.1 program separately for the soil with 5 different soil bearing coefficients (K).  Considering the top displacements and soil bearing coefficients of the building with the lowest H/B ratio among these overturned buildings, a linear relationship with 96% regression and a parabolic relationship with 99% regression were obtained for 20 models with different H/B ratios and soil bearing coefficients.",

In addition to its advantages, steel suffers from two main factors that limit its use, namely wear and corrosion. Wear and corrosion, separately or in combination, cause a material loss in steel, resulting in increased costs in industrial production. However, with appropriate surface treatments, wear and corrosion of steels can be prevented or kept to a minimum. Corrosion and wear resistances provided by appropriate methods have the potential to reduce costs and also expand the set of suitable materials that designers can choose from. In this study, brief information about steel is given and then preventive applications against wear and corrosion of steel materials are examined. Definitions were made about surface treatments such as hot-dip coatings, electrochemical coatings, electroless coatings, thermochemical surface treatments, sol-gel coatings, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), thermal spray coatings, physical vapor deposition (PVD), and the effects of surface treatments on the wear and corrosion properties of steels were investigated.

Even if is it to create a crowd ambiance in the background, the presence of individuals in groups rather than acting alone is an important element that will support this ambiance. In this study, a steering-free simulation model of real-time virtual human crowds that move together in small groups of 1-5 people, whose frequency of occurrence is compiled from real human crowds, in a formation according to the number of individuals in the group similar to real life, is proposed. In this new method, instead of creating separate collision-free and linear trajectories for each individual, a common trajectory is created for each group and all individuals in the group are ensured to move accordingly in the determined formation. The proposed method has innovations that enable creating groups with different numbers of individuals, adjusting the number of groups of each size according to the frequency of occurrence in the crowd, and determining the formation of individuals within the group according to the group size.",

The effect of explosive rate on the bonding interface of the produced Cu-Ti bimetallic composite materials was investigated by microstructure studies and mechanical tests. Optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) methods were used for the joining interface characterization. In order to determine the mechanical properties of the joining interface, tensile-shear, notch impact, bending, twisting tests and microhardness studies were carried out. As a result of the microstructure investigations, it was determined that as the explosive rate increased, the fluctuation at the bonding interface increased and accordingly, the wavelength and amplitude increased. In addition, it was determined that Cu4Ti and Cu4Ti3 intermetallic phases were formed at an explosive rate of R=3, and intermetallic phases of Cu3Ti2, Cu4Ti3, CuTi2 and CuTi3 at an explosive rate of R=3.5. As a result of the mechanical tests, it was determined that there was no visible welding defect at the bonding interface.",

The interest in Closed Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) design and optimization is increased with great care being taken to reverse logistics in order to respond to customer pressures as well as environmental concerns associated with the increasing number of end-of-life products. CLSC has extensive literature and many models have been developed to optimize supply chain costs. Most of the literature deals with single supply chains and ignores existing competing supply chains. However, in today's competitive markets, supply chains are integrated with each other by several competitive companies and work together to gain more market share. In such an environment, there are different forms of competition within and between supply chains. In this context, the paper addresses the problem of design and optimization of distribution networks in multi-level competitive CLSC management consisting of two producers, a collection & recycling center and customers trying to improve sustainable consumption by increasing the willingness to return used products with some incentives for product recovery. In order to reach a consensus solution for decision makers who have a different purpose in CLSC management, four different Interactive Fuzzy Programming (IFP) approaches are used and the results are analyzed.",

This also helps achieve zero-carbon emission goals and reduces dependency on foreign sources. Countries have made progress using renewable energy with provided incentives. Along with political and economic regulations, scientific research is crucial in raising public awareness to foster innovation. Through academic studies on renewable energy and policy, countries can create better policies and investments while promoting environmental awareness for a sustainable future. A comparative analysis of academic outputs on incentives and policies for green energy is important. This research examines the link between RE use and academic production.  To this end, a bibliometric analysis of scientific publications from Turkey, Germany, France, Spain, and Italy was employed to understand the current state policies and suggest future studies. The academic studies that were compiled with the keywords in the RE policies and measures in the Web of Science database have revealed that academic productions increase quantitatively as RE investments increase. The thematic analysis shows that the maturity in RE use is also reflected in scientific research.",

In this context, the multidisciplinary conference scheduling problem is considered a multi-constraint optimization problem. Multi-constraint optimization problems are solved with heuristic optimization techniques, not traditional optimization methods. In this study, the problem of conference scheduling is addressed using multidisciplinary conference data. The solution to the conference scheduling problem was realized with Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Epigenetic Algorithm (EGA) using C# programming language. In the study, experimental results obtained with GA and EGA were examined. As a result of this examination, it was seen that EGA achieved better results in fewer iterations compared to classical GA.",

In this study, different environmental conditions (UV irradiation, acid environment, salt water environment, accelerated aging, hydrothermal aging and thermal cycling) of glass fiber reinforced polyester composite materials containing two varied types of polyester (orthophthalic and isophthalic) and low profile additive (polystyrene and plasticizer) were investigated and the effects of environmental conditions on the wear behavior of the materials were investigated in samples containing different types of polyester and low profile additives. Considering the effects of environmental conditions on the wear resistance of the GFRP composite samples, it was observed that the wear resistance of the samples exposed to UV irradiation and hydrothermal aging increased in both samples. The use of polystyrene low profile additive in GFRP composite materials increases the wear resistance of the material. GFRP composite samples containing orthophlalic polyester resin have better wear resistance than samples containing isophlalic resin.",

Since this rating is made by the experts of each power plant, the impact and probability values of the same risk may differ, and accordingly, different risk levels may arise for the same risk. In the study, the SWARA method was used to compare the risk levels of common risks in the electricity generation process in different power plants and calculate the final weight values of the related risks. As a result of the measures determined for each risk in the electricity generation management processes in the power plants and the actions taken for these measures, it was determined whether the relevant risks were reduced to acceptable levels by looking at the results of the internal audits. In the internal audits, the performance of HEPPs in eliminating the related risks is evaluated with fuzzy expressions separately for each risk. The risk weight values obtained by the SWARA method and the fuzzy expressions obtained as a result of the risk assessment were analyzed with the Fuzzy TOPSIS method, and the performance values of the power plants in eliminating the risks were calculated, then the performance ranking was made in the light of these values.",

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) was used as a machine learning method. Some of the coordinate data that the robot arm can reach in the working space are selected and the MLP model is trained with these data. When training was done with MLP machine learning method, the correlation coefficient (R2) was obtained as 1.

These tests are simulated in 3D in MATLAB environment. The simulation results were compared with the inverse kinematics analysis data. As a result, Mean Relative Error (MRE) values for helix, star and daisy shapes were calculated as 0.0007, 0.0033 and 0.0011, respectively, in the tests performed.

In this study, GPS-based range measurement via space-born receivers’ onboard communication satellite platforms was proposed for precise orbit determination of geostationary satellites.  Thus this research investigates how proposed method can be applied to obtain reliable and sustainable results. The analysis was performed to find out the accuracy and validity of the proposed method. Moreover, the results were compared with the simulation of four satellites’ orbital parameters at different orbital slots. The sequential process (SP) Kalman filter method was chosen to process the measured data. The processing method was kept the same for all analyses to investigate the gathered measurement data effects. The results show that the average position differences between the determined and actual orbit are 17.613 m, 13.637 m and 14.998 m, for in-track, cross-track, and radial direction. The average in-track, cross-track, and radial velocity differences are 0.339 cm/s, 0.160 cm/s, and 0.066 cm/s respectively. The results show that the proposed method is approved in communication satellites orbit determination.

Microstructural evolutions, phase transformations, and crystallite size changes were investigated depending on the milling time. XRD and SEM results showed that there were a more homogeneous structure and shrinkage in grain size due to the increased milling time. The DTA results showed an endothermic peak of around 650 oC which indicates the melting temperature of Al. Besides, the mechanical properties of the pressed and sintered composites were investigated by Vickers micro-hardness testing. The results showed that microhardness values significantly increased as milling time increased from 5h to 10h.

In this paper, grey wolf optimization (GWO) is used to optimize the microgrid system for effective dispatching of power to load with economic manner. The model of microgrid system components are developed and investigated in the MATLAB/Simulink platform. The vital objective of the proposed grey wolf algorithm is to minimize overall cost of the microgrid operation. The detailed investigation is carried out on power dispatch optimization and cost minimization for both modes, i.e. island and grid-connected modes of the microgrid system with considering the impact of running costs. From the analysis, the cost of the overall system is optimized effectively, and load sharing is done effectively by means of GWO.",

The main problem observed in nanofluids used in heat transfer applications is their instability. Researchers have developed and proposed some solutions to obtain stable nanofluids. One of the most important solutions, is the nanoparticles surface modification method. In this work, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were subjected to chemical processes and their surfaces were modified. Three different modified nanoparticles were synthesized, which are Fe3O4@SiO2@Si(CH2)3-IM [Cl], Fe3O4@Si(CH2)3-IM [Cl], and Fe3O4@SiO2&Si(CH2)3-IM [Cl] nanoparticles. The nanofluids were prepared in 0.2% Vol. fraction by using the produced particles in base fluid which was distilled water, and stability of nanofluids were observed for 3 months. Nanofluids were subjected to ultrasonication for 3.5 h to obtain homogeneous nanofluid. Not modified water-based Fe3O4 nanofluid completely collapsed in approximately 1 week. In modified nanofluids, although sedimentation occurred, it was observed that a certain amount of the particles remained suspended even after 3 months. The most important analyses in this study are Scanning Electron Microscope, X-Ray Diffraction, and Transmission Electron Microscope.",

Numerical analysis was carried out steady and in three dimensions with the k-ε turbulence model Ansys-Fluent program. Considering the studies in the literature, three models were placed in the channels in accordance with the channel dimensions. The Re number range of the fluids in the channel is 5000-9000. The results were matched with the Nu results of the experimental study in the literature and they were determined to be compatible. The results of the study were examined comparatively for water and nanofluid as mean Nu number and surface temperature changes for each model in channels at different channel heights in finless and finned cases. In addition, velocity and temperature contour distributions of the combined jet nanofluid flow were presented. However, performance evaluation numbers (PEC) at different Reynolds numbers and average Nu number (Num) and surface temperature values (Tm) were evaluated for Re=7000 for all three model surfaces in the channels. The use of Diamond-Water nanofluid in the H=3D and finned channel resulted in 24.14% and 18.91% higher Num values on cube and trapezoidal surfaces compared to the finless and water-fluid channel, respectively.",

Boiler, one of the mostimportant ship auxiliary engines, is used for several purposes that consist ofheating of fuel tanks, machinery equipment and accommodation. Many problems canarise in boilers which are designed to work with main engine exhaust gas sothat the waste heat can be used in order to match expectations of energyefficiency requirements. When ship systems are analyzed, it is understood thatmany systems are related to each other. If there is a problem with the boilermany systems will be affected and many problems will be encountered. Therefore,this study provides a fuzzy DEMATEL (Decision Making Trial and EvaluationLaboratory) method to assess most common critical operational faults in marineboilers. The DEMATEL method gives chances to identify and analyses theimportant faults of marine boiler with respect to cause effect relationshipdiagram. Likewise, fuzzy sets get through with the uncertainty in decisionmaking and experts comments on DEMATEL. When the results are examined, it isunderstood that “boiler takes excessive time to reach pressure” is important interms of the reasons. When the effects are examined, it is seen that the mostimportant effect is “leakage from pipes or valves”.

The elevation differences occurred by sediment loads weredetermined from drawing bottom profiles. In addition, using theelevation-area-volume method, the volumetric and areal losses of water inreservoir dead, active and total volume for 26 years were calculated. As aresult, the volume of the dam was filled with the sediment. From the results,it has been observed that up to 10 meters of elevation occurs on the bottom ofthe reservoir due to sediment deposition.Approximately 30% of the dead volume determining the useful life of thedam was filled with sediment.",

The structural, optical andelectrical properties of ternary ZTSe thin films were investigated depending onthe annealing temperature at 250 and 300°C. X-ray diffraction analysis showedthat as-grown films were in amorphous structure, however annealing at 250°Ctriggered the crystallization on the preferred ternary structure and annealingat 300°C resulted in the changes from amorphous to the polycrystallinestructure. Using the compositional analysis, the detail information about thestoichiometry and the segregation mechanisms of the constituent elements in thestructure were determined for both as-grown and annealed samples. In addition,they were morphologically characterized using scanning electron microscopytechnique. The electrical properties were analyzed using temperature dependentdark- and photo-conductivity measurements. From the variation of electricalconductivity as a function of the ambient temperature, the current transportmechanisms and corresponding activation energies at specific temperatureintervals for each sample were determined. The optical properties for the ZTSethin films were studied depending on the structural changes with annealing.",

Because of this, it isdifficult to determine the daily food demand, and this causes cost, time andlabor loss for the institutions. Statistical or heuristic methods are used toremove or at least minimize these losses. In this study, an artificialintelligence model was proposed, which estimates the daily food demand quantityusing artificial neural networks for businesses.

Whole system  heat pump performance coefficient values werevaried between 3 and 3,44 for carrots and between 3,15 and 3,43 for apples. Itis seen that the performance coefficient of the heat pump is increased by transferringthe waste air from the drying chamber to the evaporator surface, and  70% of this air sent to the evaporatorsurface is composed of waste air and 30% is composed of ambient air.

        "abstract": "Inductionmotors are widely used electrical machines in converting electrical energy intomechanical energy. Common faults ıf induction motors are divided into twogroups as electrical and mechanical faults. Electrical faults consist of statorfaults and rotor faults. Mechanical faults include bearing failures, axialmisalignment and other faults related to the mechanical components of themotor. Bearing failures has significant share in mechanical faults. One of themain causes of bearing failures isthe  misalignment between themotor and the load. In this paper, the effects of the misalignment problemsbetween an induction motor and a load are investigated. A star-flexible couplingwas used between the induction motor and the load. The motor was loaded with aself-excited synchronous generator. Motor-load (synchronous generator)misalignments were gradually adjusted by a laser coupling alignment tool. Ateach alignment level the stator current and vibration signals were recorded.Current and vibration signals were analyzed in the frequency domain. Thenentropies of current and vibration signals were calculated. The change in theentropy of current and vibration signals due to misalignment were investigatedexperimentally. It has been shown that the misalignment problems can beanalyzed with the change in entropy of stator current and vibration signals.",

In this software, periods are obtained with the SAP2000 OAPI, depending on the individual extraction of each of the structural elements. According to the 2007 and 2018 Turkish Earthquake Regulations, building periods and building element extraction scenarios are comparatively rapidly iterated. As a result, repetitive structural analyzes, which will take very long time under normal conditions, are made in a very short time with the software created and all structural elements are evaluated on a period-by-term basis with the possibility of constituting a structural problem. With this aspect, the study provides a rapid solution in the field of civil engineering for creating damage scenarios and performing multi-dimensional analysis. At the same time, it contributes to the need to use computer automations in the evaluation of building elements.",

The aim ofthe study is to examine the evaluability of wood bark which isforest/industrial waste as a sorbent and to optimize the working conditions. Inthis context, poplar tree bark was selected as raw material and it wasactivated with two different agents (KOH and K2CO3) aftercarbonization. Experimental sets were arranged by using 25fullfactorial experimental design model and variance analysis was performed byusing the %removal efficiency values ​​obtained from the sorption process. Therelationship of five parameters, namely solution pH, dye concentration, contacttime, sorbent dosage and temperature, were investigated and it was concludedthat the most effective parameter was pH in 95% confidence level for allsorbents. In the experiments conducted with poplar bark, it was observed thatbinary interactions were also effective. The highest %removal efficiency value(95.6%) was achieved when KOH-activated sorbent was used. According to theisotherm and kinetic models, it was determined that sorption was performed byphysicochemical interactions on a monolayer homogeneous surface. Consequently,wastewater containing dyestuffs can be treated at low cost with the design ofenvironmental-friendly and high-efficiency process via the evaluation offorestry/industrial wastes.",

AlSi7Mg0.3 aluminum alloyand silicon carbide (SiC) particles were used as matrix and reinforcementmaterials to produce composite samples. Firstly, stirring processes wereapplied as the combination of mechanical stirring and ultrasonic vibration forthe various time as 3-1, 2-2 and 1-3 minutes, respectively. To determine theeffect of stirring process, tensile tests were applied to whole samples andQuality Indexes (QI) were calculated by using the results of tensile tests.According to the values of QI, the produced samples with the combination of 1minute mechanical stirring and 3 minutes ultrasonic vibration showed themaximum mechanical properties. Afterwards, the determined stirring combinationwas chosen to specify the appropriate molten metal temperature. Three differentcasting temperatures were addressed as 700˚C, 720˚C and 740˚C. According tomechanical tests results and calculations of QI and metallographic analysis,the maximum mechanical properties were obtained with aluminum compositereinforced with 1 wt. % SiC at 720˚C molten metal temperature by applying 1minute mechanical stirring and 3 minutes ultrasonic vibration.",

Chemours Refrigerant Expert 1.0 and GenetronProperties 1.4 were used for the design of the vapor compression cycle. Whilethe condensing temperature was kept constant during the analyses, theevaporation temperatures were determined according to the EUROVENT conditions(0 °C, -8 °C, -25 °C, -31 °C). The parameters calculated according to differentevaporation temperatures are the required compressor power, performancecoefficient (COP), and the required refrigerant mass flow rate. The resultsshowed that the COP values of the R438A and R417A refrigerants were very closeto that of R22. The COP values were 5%, 6%, 15% and 10% lower in R438A, inR471A, in R422A, and in R422D, respectively compared to the R22 refrigerant.The COP values were calculated as 13% for R422D and 17% for R422A. The highestexergy efficiency of the analyzed systems was calculated as 31.74% for R438A,31% for R417A, 27.46% for R422A, and 29.24% for R422D at -25°C evaporationtemperature. The results of our study revealed that among the R417A, R438A, R422Aand R422D refrigerants developed as an alternative to R22 refrigerant, theR438A refrigerant had comparatively higher COP values. Also, when the condenserand compressor loads were examined, it was found that the R438A, R417A, R422Dand R422A refrigerants yielded the best results, respectively.

Turkey has experienced it by living on March 31, 2015. The switching to smart grids is inevitable in order to minimize human errors and avoid big failures. It is a solution to turn the appropriate zones back to the island mode, especially in case of emergency load shedding due to the basic frequency. However, large power fluctuations occur in the microgrids when switching to the island mode or connecting to the grid. Therefore, In Matlab / Simulink, a microgrid is designed that can operate in island mode in accordance with the smart grid structure to minimize the damage of symmetrical and asymmetrical of high voltage lines on loads, grid and its components in this study. Also the effects of Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) have been studied to limit power fluctuations in the microgrid when switching to island mode and exit island mode. In addition, autonomous maneuver management has been carried out on the designed high voltage line to prevent faults resulting in long term power cut.",

        "abstract": "In this study, microstructure, microhardness and tribological properties were investigated after nitrocarburisation process (on the AISI 4140 steel) which was the oxidation processes based on simultaneous diffusion of carbon and nitrogen atoms. Although the nitrocarburisation process has many advantages, different post-treatment heat treatment techniques are needed to improve the corrosion and tribological properties of the materials in particular. As a result of the nitrocarburization + oxidation processes, 3 different zones were formed on the outermost surface of the material. These zones were obtaining of respectively as; about 5 mm thick oxide layer, just below it, about 5 mm thick compound layer consisting of nitride and carbides and diffusion zone rich in carbide. Wear behavior on the entire surface of the material was improved by means of a harder diffusion zone, nitrocarburization and oxidation layers than the main phase. Thus, the wear resistance is also improved, as well as the coefficient of friction.",

The storage tank volume isoptimized by considering two big tanks and five small tanks. The results showthat night cooling reduces cooling water temperature by 5.8 °C or 21.8% whilethe cooling efficiency is increased by 36%. The thermal storage tanks enable tohave the low continuous flow rate and help to reduce the fan power by 67.1%. Onthe storage side, compared to two tanks system, the tanks volume is reduced by16.5% when 5 tanks are used. In theory this reduction can go up to 50% byincreasing the number of tanks and reducing their individual size.",

To determine the most appropriate alternative, 4 decision makerswere asked to evaluate alternatives in terms of environmental impact, operatingrisk, installation cost, operating cost, generated product diversity andapplicability in Turkey. These evaluation criteria of decision makers wereexpressed with 5 point decision scale and fuzzy numbers and analyzed withVisual PROMETHEE software. According to the results, when the PROMETHEE I andII analysis of PROMETHEE and fuzzy PROMETHEE approaches were taken intoconsideration, the same order of alternatives was found as recycling> use asalternative fuel> pyrolysis. However, the PROMETHEE Rainbow analysis of thetwo approaches showed differences in positive and negative criteria affectingalternatives.

Coke oven gas realesed by carbonization may be an alternative fuel for gas turbine combustor. The non-premixedturbulent combustion in this combustor was modelled by using Ansys Fluent code. Numerical models used in this study involvedthe k-ε model of turbulent flow, the Mixture Fraction/PDF model of non-premixed combustion and P-1 radiation model. Themodelling was performed for 60 kW heat input and λ=1.1, λ=1.3 and λ=1.5 excess air ratios. According to the results, themaximum temperature for 60 kW and λ=1.1 methane combustion condition was 2230 K and this temperature value was themaximum temperature for all combustion conditions. Temperature decreases in the combustor and combustor’s exit zone wereobserved with increasing secondary air and with adding dilution air. In similar conditions, the maximum temperature distributionwas observed of 2150 K for 60 kW and λ=1.1 combustion condition for coke oven gas combustion. The temperature levelsobtained for coke oven gas were slightly lower than temperature levels for methane combustion. Although slight differencebetween the temperature levels, temperature distributions for both fuels are very similar and coke oven gas may be an alternativeto methane for gas turbine combustors",

Maximum cutting force (Fz) and maximum torque values were measured during the drilling process. The effects of cutting speed, feed rate, and drill and workpiece material on the maximum cutting force and torque were investigated. Increasing the feed rate generally lifted the maximum cutting forces up for the test parts. However, the cutting speed did not have a clear effect on the maximum cutting forces. In drilling of AISI D3 cold work tool steel, higher forces were obtained than those obtained in drilling of AISI D2 cold work tool steel.

ACFD code has been used to perform numerical analysis. Combustion has beenmodelled by using the PDF/Mixture Fraction combustion model, standard k-Ɛturbulence model as turbulence model and P-1 radiation model as radiationmodel. The amount of oxygen in the air has been changed from 21 % to 30 %, 40 %and 50 %. According to the predictions, it can be readily said that the flametemperatures of the coke oven and the town gases increases underoxygen-enriched combustion conditions. Therefore, it is demonstrated that thecombustion performances of the coke oven and town gases have been improvedunder oxygen-enriched combustion. When the results are evaluated in terms ofemissions, it has been determined that CO emissions decrease while CO2emissions increase as the air is enriched with oxygen. It has been alsoconcluded that NOX emission levels increase under oxygen-enriched combustionconditions due to increases in flame temperatures of the coke oven and the towngases. The maximum flame temperature level has been predicted as of almost 2200K under % O2-included air conditions just as the maximum NOX level has beenalso predicted as about 1500 ppm under the same conditions.",

Since beamsfrom the lamps do not come parallel to the collector like solar beams, it wouldbe misleading to use the absorber projection area in the calculation ofefficiency. As a more realistic approach, a method that calculates the angularabsorber area of beams was developed. While collector efficiency that dependson the collector absorber projection area varies between 116% and 80%,collector efficiency that depends on the field of the angular absorber haschanged between 56% and 38%. These results obtained from the experimental studyreveal the importance of determining the collector’s area to be used in thesolar simulator for the efficiency calculation of evacuated tube solarcollector tests.

Many researchers are investigating the use of recycledaggregate in concrete because 70-75% of concrete is composed of aggregates andusing aggregates produced from waste concrete has environmental, ecologic andeconomic impacts and reduces the energy and natural resources consumption. Inthis study properties of aggregates provided from crushing waste concrete andalso engineering properties of concrete made from these aggregates have beeninvestigated. Fine and coarse recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) were replacedin the ratio of 0, 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% with fine and coarse crushedaggregates in concrete mix design. CEM I 42,5 R cement was used as a binder andreplaced by 20% of the cement’s weight with fly ash in all mixtures. Due to thehigh water absorption of the RCA in comparison to the crushed aggregates, theslump was decreased by increasing RCA substitution ratio in the mixtures.Control concrete (CC) has gained the highest compressive strength in all ages.28 and 90-day compressive strength of normally cured concretes, the bondstrength between concrete specimens and rebars and compressive strength ofconcretes subjected to the wetting and drying cycles were decreased byincreasing RCA substitution ratio in the mixtures.",

Turkey, as a developing country and a highly experiencedcandidate to European Union membership, determines relevant energy policies byassessing domestic energy potentials. However, no official target for energyutilization from the seas is officially set so far. Wave energy can be one ofthe alternatives that can contribute to the energy mix of Turkey. Thiscontribution would also positively affect the fossil fuel import rates of thecountry while the wave energy conversion technologies mature and penetrate theenergy markets. With this in mind, wave energy potentials have been calculatedfor two locations, Riva and Foça; based on the data measured and obtained fromthe Office of Navigation, Hydrography and Oceanography of Turkish Navy.Comparatively low wave energy level results are obtained, mainly caused by themeasurement sites are not on the shores of open sea or oceans, but inner seas.These results would hopefully help the respective engineers to reach the mostsuitable designs for these wave characteristics.",

This structure is repeated in many plates.  After the differential equation is convertedto the finite difference equation, it proceeds in a row by starting from thecorner where the two inlet temperatures are known, and thus the temperatureprofile of the entire heat exchanger is easily reached. Throughout the study,air was used as cold fluid in all analysis. Air and exhaust gases were taken ashot fluid, thus the performance of the heat exchanger was examined. Amathematical model was developed by using the finite difference equations inJava programming language. For example, the temperature profile of a hot airwith an inlet temperature of 75 C and the temperature profile of a cold airwith an inlet temperature of 20 C were calculated  with the aid of the mathematical model andthe total heat transfer was determined approximately 45,5 KW.",

At this point, the carbon and manganese ratio of the material has a considerable influence on the microstructure of the cast part after the heat treatment. Therefore, heat treatment conditions have to be determined appropriately depending on the chemical composition of the material. In this study, heat treatment processes were applied to high manganese steel specimens having GX120MnCr18-2 DIN standard at various austenitizing temperatures between 1030~1100 oC. The specimens were examined under an optical microscope and SEM/EDS analyses were performed. Impact resistance and hardness values of the above-mentioned specimens were measured via the tests performed with TS EN ISO 148-1 and TS EN 130 6508-1 standards, respectively. From these investigations, it was determined that the carbide solubility increased as the austenitizing temperature increased while the impact resistance first increased and then decreased.",

The surface plates of the composite samples were produced from carbon fibre/epoxy prepreg material. Nomex honeycomb core material was used to make the composite sandwich structure via an autoclave process. For the bird-like impact test, the tip of the impactor was coated with thick, tough rubber to simulate a bird strike; the diameter of the impactor was 25 mm to ensure similarity with a bird called Pica nuttalli (magpie), which has a mass of 155 g and is the closest bird body to the simulations. Three different predetermined impact scenarios with kinetic energy 380 Joule, 276 Joule, and 224 Joule were applied to the samples with rubber impactors of similar density, to simulate bird impact events with different impact directions.The impact behaviour was characterised by velocity-time, force-time, and displacement-time graphs. Different levels of damage were observed in the composite samples, but none of the sandwich test samples were perforated, and it could therefore be concluded that the unmanned air vehicle could land without risk to flight safety. This low-velocity bird-like impact was also modelled and analysed using a numerical program to verify the results, and it was concluded that the verified model could also be used for the preliminary design verification of dynamic bird-impact tests within the 10% sensitivity range.",

After 50 days, the soil samples beneath each mulch and on the control field were collected, where the bacteria and fungi population as well as the physio-chemical properties of the soil were measured. The severe reduction in bacterial population in soil under the agro foil and mulches made of PLA fibres occurs due to the prevalence of high soil temperature. The bacterial population of soil beneath the mulches made of viscose fibre significantly increased due to favourable anaerobic conditions, respectively soil temperature and moisture. Under all mulches, compared to the control field, a higher fungal population was observed. The fungal population under the nonwoven mulch produced by viscose fibres was 161% higher in comparison to the control field. The available nutrient contents of soils under the nonwoven mulches were higher compared to the control field. The control field showed higher available nutrient contents of soil than the field covered by conventional agro foil.The results of the study reveal that usage of nonwoven mulches made of viscose fibres is most appropriate for short-term mulching application since successfully increases microbial population and improves the physio-chemical properties of soil.",

Aircraft are also at risk of being struck by lightning and there is currently no way to prevent this from happening. Instead, efforts are being made to protect by reducing the effects of lightning. Metal structures in aircraft form a Faraday cage which helps in preventing lightning currents from entering the aircraft. However, composite structures, which are becoming more prevalent in the aviation sector, are less efficient in doing so compared to metals. Additionally, openings such as windows in the aircraft can break the Faraday cage and allow strong electromagnetic fields to penetrate. Hence, all equipment used on board the aircraft must be adequately qualified and lightning-proof. The most popular technique used to reduce the indirect effects of lightning on electronics is cable shielding. In this study, various shielding termination techniques for their effectiveness against indirect effect of lightning examined and It is found that utilizing a 360˚ backshell termination technique provided to be highly effective, providing protection of nearly 3 dB.

        "abstract": "Computer-Automated Design is the process of design by computer and without human intervention. Studies on simultaneous size, shape, and topology optimization show that computer-aided design is poised to replace computer-aided design. Most studies presented on simultaneous size, shape, and topology optimization measure the performance of the proposed optimization method (or method improvement) with popular test problems. These test problems are designed using a number of simplifications to allow them to be solved in an acceptable time; and therefore they cannot represent real world problems. Moreover, in most of the mentioned problems, only structural constraints are considered and constructability constraints are neglected. Structural constraints are related to the material used (stress, strain, etc.) and the behavior of the structural system (node displacement, global buckling, etc.). On the other hand, constructability constraints are the constraints that are related to manufacturing, such as the absence of intersecting elements in the system and not connecting many elements to a node. In this study, the real computational load of computer-automated design of plane truss systems is discussed. What is meant by the expression “real computational load” here is the computational effort spent searching for near-optimal solutions to design problems, where there are no simplistic constraints that are not found in real-world problems, and where constructability constraints are taken into account as well as structural constraints. Numerical experiments were performed using a parameterless metaheuristic algorithm, which has been shown by previous studies to be suitable for the optimization of truss systems, and the results are discussed.",

        "abstract": "In this study, the effects of the parameters such as angle of internal friction and unit weight, which are selected based on the estimate for the filling material, on the factor of safety of the geogrid against rupture and pullout were investigated by using the design parameters of the geogrid-reinforced retaining walls on a highway that was completed and put into service. As a result of the analysis, it was observed that when the angle of internal friction increased, the factor of safety against rupture and pullout increased and the factor of safety against pullout were higher than the factor of safety against rupture. In this respect, it was concluded that the factor of safety against rupture is more critical in the design calculations and the main factor controlling the design is the factor of safety against rupture. However, it was observed that the factor of safety against pullout was more affected by the changes in the angle of internal friction compared to the factor of safety against rupture. For example, a 15% increase in the angle of internal friction results in an increase of approximately 30% in the factor of safety against rupture, whereas it caused an increase of approximately 310% at z = 1.2 m and approximately 60% at z =10 m in the factor of safety against pullout. It was observed that the effect of the changes in the unit weight of the filling material on the factor of safety against rupture and pullout of the geogrid was not considerable (about 10% and 3%, respectively). When compared among themselves, it was seen that the effect of the changes in the unit weight of the filling material on the factor of safety against rupture was higher than the effect on the factor of safety against pullout.",

Input variables, training procedures, and network design significantly impact the accuracy of Neural Network models' predictions. MATLAB software created three distinct ANN models for this investigation, each employing unique training setups and procedures. Matlab graphs guided the selection of algorithms and models based on minimizing MAE and RMSE while maximizing the linear correlation coefficient (R). The RMSE value obtained according to the calculations was 3.5881e^(-6), and the R value was 0.99998. The network's estimated data was compared to the training and testing cosθ data, yielding an RMSE error of 0.43% and an R2 value of 0.99978, indicating high accuracy.

In the context of the investigation, firstly 5-8 µm or 12-15 µm zinc-coating in an alkaline (Zn, Zn-Fe, Zn-Ni) or an acidic (Zn, Zn-Ni) environment, followed by 20-25 µm cataphoresis-coating were performed on GGG40 cast-parts. Ink, hogabom, shock, pull-off adhesion, water resistance, salt spray, stone impact, cyclic-corrosion, and scab-corrosion performance tests were implemented for characterization. In addition, the zinc-coating thickness and the phosphate-crystal appearance were evaluated in the x-ray diffraction laminography instrument and the scanning electron microscope. The tensile strengths were determined by the pull-off adhesion test between 171 and 433 psi. The coating thicknesses of zinc-coated parts in alkaline and acidic environments were assigned in the range of 5.88-7.18 µm and 12.10-12.96 µm. Due to the characterization results; it was deduced that the cataphoresis-coating after all zinc-based-coatings under alkaline medium did not afford the required quality and corrosion protection, while cast parts coated under acidic medium before cataphoresis-coating gave appropriate corrosion performance, thus the low-cost coatings could be performed with the eligible properties.",

This study conducted experimental performance analyses of these two dc/dc boost circuits in a system with a battery group and a wireless EV charging structure. The study presents that in the interleaved synchronous dc/dc boost topology at the same power values, inductor currents and output voltage/current ripple decrease, and efficiency increases.

Stent designs with a Negative Poisson’s ratio provide a minimum foreshortening rate. However, dogboning does not occur in stent expansion. In this study, the stent-artery coverage ratio was determined as 26.3% for the NPR stent, which was designed as four unit cells in the circumferential wall direction. A four-stage numerical analysis of the NPR stent was performed within the three-layered arterial structure including asymmetric plaque. In the analyzes made for the NPR stent with high yield strength and low strut thickness in the PLLA material model, the foreshortening ratio was 12% and the recoil ratio was 1.19%.

Drilling performance was evaluated in terms of resulting surface roughness (Ra), cutting temperature (T) and energy consumption (SEC). The drilling experiment design was prepared using the L27 orthogonal array of the Taguchi method. Cutting parameters and drill helix angles were optimized using Ra, T and SEC values. Experimental results were first evaluated with three-dimensional graphics. The obtained data were statistically analyzed using signal/noise ratio (S/N), analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis. In addition, Ra, T and SEC variables were optimized together using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA). As a result of this study, optimum Ra, T and SEC values were reached in A3B3C1, A1B1C1 and A1B3C3 experimental combinations, respectively. The most effective parameters on Ra, T and SEC were found to be 54.93% f, 52.02% Vc and 68.12% f, respectively. The optimum experimental combination for Ra, T and SEC was A1B1C1 as a result of GRA analysis. The results predicted by the mathematical models developed as a result of the analysis were found to yield high-accuracy results. In addition, it was observed that BUE and chip adhesion generally occurred in the drill bits.",

Within these systems, Internet of Things (IoT)-based network devices are especially exposed to a lot of cyber-attacks and are vulnerable to these attacks. This adversely affects the operation of the devices in question, and the data is endangered due to security vulnerabilities. Therefore, in this study, a model that detects cyber-attacks to ensure security with machine learning (ML) algorithms were proposed by using the data obtained from the log records of an IoT-based system. For this, first, the dataset was created, and this dataset was preprocessed and prepared in accordance with the models. Then, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithms were used to create the models. As a result, the best performance to detect cyber-attacks was obtained using the RF algorithm with a rate of 99.6%. Finally, the results obtained from all the models created were compared with other academic studies in the literature and it was seen that the proposed RF model produced very successful results compared to the others. Moreover, this study showed that RF was a promising method of attack detection.",

        "abstract": "In Direct Current (DC) motor speed controllers, resisting disturbances and tracking the set point with minimum error against any external factors is critical. The most common type of DC motor disturbance is sudden load changes. As a result, controllers must build a quick and effective response to sudden load changes while deviating as little as possible from the reference values. The responses of model-based and data-driven control approaches to sudden load changes in DC motors are studied in this paper. Data-driven control (DDC) is a learning-based control system that designs and optimizes the controller based on collected input-output data. A mathematical model of the system is calculated in model-based control (MBC). Within the scope of the study, the Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) method is analyzed both model-based and data-driven. In addition, artificial neural networks (ANN) and nonlinear autoregressive with exogenous input (NARX) controllers are also investigated as data-driven methods. Thus, the performances of three different approaches for DC motor speed control: model-based, data-driven, and data-driven + time series were investigated. In the experimental studies, real motors were used, not simulations, and the experiments were carried out in real-time using permanent magnet DC motors with 100 rpm (DAM1) and 300 rpm (DAM2) speeds. The results were presented using total normalized error, rise time, and maximum percentage overshoot metrics, and the methods' performance was discussed.",

This study aims to establish a new ranking with a Multi-Criteria Decision Making Method (MCDM) that considers the time dimension for developing the INFORM methodology. In the study, 19 countries were included in the evaluation. The data set for these countries was obtained from the INFORM reports published by the European Commission in 2015-2023. The 9-year risk management performance was analyzed with the model proposed in the study. In addition, due to the inclusion of the time dimension in the evaluation stages, a new risk management performance ranking of the countries was created. Country rankings obtained with the TOPSIS-G approach and INFORM orders were compared using Spearman and Kendall Tau-b non-parametric correlations. The results show a high correlation between the two rankings. According to the risk management performance ranking, the areas that need to be improved in the disaster management stages for the countries covered in the study were drawn to attention and suggestions were made.",

In order to achieve the real-timecommunication, initially the analog master circuit has been implemented togenerate chaotic sequences of numbers.

Besides, the slave circuit has also received a copy of that chaoticsequences in order to use it in subtraction process of image gray levels. Thedigital chaotic image has been transmitted to the slave circuit via adigital/analog converter with an efficient method and the decrypted image hasbeen obtained in real-time. The advantage of that technique over theconversional ones is that it does not require any saved copy of the digitaldata, even for sending them in gray images to the receiver, since it isreal-time. The conventional techniques use the stored and processed data andthat can cause security problems in today’s advanced web media.

        "abstract": "The problem of energy efficiency due to the limited resources in WirelessSensor Networks (WSNs) has made cluster-based architectures widespread use inthese networks. The studies in literature regarding WSNs aim to make efficientuse of battery in network by different methods such as using differentparameters in cluster head selection, time-based cluster head election orclustering with artificial intelligence algorithms. The coverage area ofclusters is selected in a range that can cover the whole network in somestudies, while it is limited in others. In this study, the effect of thecluster-head coverage area parameter on the lifetime of the network isinvestigated with detailed simulations. The death of the first, middle, andlast node are reported by using different numbers of nodes, coverage areas, andnetwork sizes. According to the results obtained, the increase of the clustercoverage area causes the first node deaths to be delayed and the middle andlast node deaths to occur earlier. The increase of the network area takes allthe node measurements at an early cycle while the first node is at the highestlevel and the last node at the lowest level. As the number of nodes increases,the first node deaths are delayed to an earlier cycle, while the middle andfinal node deaths are delayed. In the light of the results obtained, it isthought that this study will help the cluster coverage area to be selectedaccording to the design preferences in clustering based architectures that willbe designed both in real time and in the simulation environment in future.",

The aim of this problem is to increase the usabilityof the material used for the placement process and to minimize the trim loss.In this study, a solution is presented to two-dimensional regular cutting andpacking problem by a combined method consisting of improved bottom-left,bottom-left fill placement algorithms, no-fit polygon and first fit decreasingheuristic algorithms. The improved bottom-left placement algorithm for theplacement of parts starting from the bottom-left part according to a certainpermutation order, bottom-left fill algorithm for the placement of suitablepieces to the available free spaces in placement model, no-fit polygon methodfor preventing the geometric overlap between the parts and the first fitdecreasing heuristic algorithm is used as the selection algorithm afterordering from large to small according to the parts areas. Placement processand performance evaluation was performed for 11 different test data. As aresult of the studies carried out with combined heuristic methods, it is seenthat there is a placement without any waste in P2 and P10 placement models.This shows that the optimal solution is obtained. In other placement models, atrim loss was obtained between 4.54% and 16.7%.

Life-cycle costanalysis is often used as an optimization method in determining the thicknessof the insulation in buildings. In literature, the insulation thickness whichthe total cost is minimum is defined as the optimum insulation thickness. Inthis study, the optimum insulation thicknesses of residential buildings inTurkey were determined by life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA). The annual heatingenergy requirement of the buildings are calculated according to the TurkishStandard 825, Thermal Insulation Requirements for Buildings. Glass wool,extruded polystyrene (XPS) and expanded polystyrene (EPS) are used for ceiling,floor and wall as insulation material respectively and natural gas is used asfuel. Life-cycle cost analysis based on the total cost approach is used as theoptimization method. Optimum insulation thicknesses (U-values) based on climatezones for a period of 30 years are calculated between 14,2 cm and 26,8 cm (0,29-0,16W/m2K) for ceiling, 5,0 cm and 9,8 cm (0,57-0,32 W/m2K)for floor, 8,1 cm and 16,4 cm (0,38-0,20 W/m2K) for wall. As aresult, when compared with the limited insulation thicknesses specified in TS825 standard, it has been determined that the energy savings to be provided byan insulation building using optimum insulation thicknesses vary between 10,08%and 18,88% according to the region. These results have reached the conclusionthat optimum insulation thicknesses (U-values) should be revised for all regionsspecified in the TS 825 standard, as the increase in payback period isconsidered not to exceed 10% even in the worst case.",

This parameter is not onlyincreasing day by day due to unsustainable fossil fuels, but also brings heavyburdens to economies. In case of Turkey, logistic strategies had to beconsidered inevitably. For this purpose, along general comparison made bytaking the data of logistic performance index (LPI) issued biennially by WorldBank into consideration, Mexico included in the same category in said index hasbeen taken as the sample and then the logistic sector has been analyzed andcompared. As a result, it was shown that Mexico and Turkey had poor transportinfrastructure, lack of legislation, lack of independent logistics managementand lack of independent port authority. In addition to them, it has been seenthat the railway infrastructure should be less developed than behind the roadinfrastructure and the ports should be strengthened with highway-railconnections. Geostrategically, both countries have a similar structure but alsohave lack of data on the logistics sector. It has been asserted that regionsfor combined transport in both countries should be identified and logisticsareas should be established.",

Due to theintense use of unmanned aerial vehicles in the instant surveillance, tracking,detection and disposal of targets, it is an important and difficult problem todetermine which of the different types of air vehicles in the field ofoperations should be selected and how they can be effectively routed. In thisstudy, a multi-criteria solution approach based on heuristic algorithm isproposed for destroying moving targets taking into account of the capacity andtime window constraints by armed and unarmed unmanned aerial vehicles moving asa fleet. The Analytical Hierarchical Process method was used to prioritize thetargets and pursuers; and it was aimed to destroy all targets with a minimumnumber of vehicles in a short time due to the cost of flights with UAVs,increase in maintenance-repair costs and the risk of fault due to unnecessaryUAV use, the use of large numbers of UAVs in the field of operation evokedenemy elements and directed them to take defensive measures against UAVs. Theeffectiveness of the algorithm has been tested on 25 different scenarios wherethe number of pursuers is between 10 and 50 and the target number ranges from40 to 200. As a result, it has been determined that all targets are destroyedwith minimum number of vehicles according to the specified order of prioritywithin the acceptable solution period and the proposed method contributed tothe efficient routing of (heterogeneous) unmanned aerial vehicles moving in afleet.",

All numerical calculations have been performed with FLUENT, a computational fluid dynamics code. P-1 radiation model has been chosen for all numerical calculations. In addition, the swirl number has been taken 0.4 value to validate the results with respect to reference experimental data. All comparisons have been performed in axial and radial temperature distributions according to experimental data. Firstly, the number ofswirlhas been defined as a user-defined function. Thus, the effect of defining user-defined functions has been examined in the swirl number. Secondly, the model constant (A) of the eddy dissipation combustion model has been investigated to determine suitable value. After that, the eddy dissipation and PDF mixture fraction combustion models have been compared with each other. Finally,k-εstandard, realizable and RNG models have been analyzed to determine the proper turbulence model. The results showed that to define the swirl number as a user-defined function in the comparison tests has not been an important effect to obtain good agreement with the experimental temperature distribution data. It has been found that the value of one for the Eddy dissipation model constant is suitable for this model. It has also been found that the experimental results in both combustion models give approximate results, but the PDF model is particularly better at axial temperature distribution. Moreover, it has been seen that the k-ε realizable turbulence model is more suitable for this model.",

        "abstract": "The most important energy source of the world is the sun. Solar energy can be converted to electricity by using photovoltaic (PV) solar panels. It is known that maximum electrical efficiency of PV solar panels is around 15%-20%. Therefore, it is clear that PV solar panels are not very efficient. This is due to some reasons. One of the most important of these reasons is the increase in the temperature of the PV solar panel. Therefore, PV solar panels should be cooled by means of any cooling methods. For this reason, in this study, the effect of temperature on electrical efficiency of PV solar panels has been investigated experimentally. For this purpose, an experimental setup, containing two PV solar panels with and without cooling, was installed. In this experimental setup, unlike the general literature a flowing water film, which is on the panel, obtains the cooling. It has been determined that power output of the cooled solar panel is greater than without cooling one. A 11.143 W electrical power has been gained from the PV panel due to cooling obtained by flowing water film. The average power increase by means of designed cooling system is about 9.51%. As a result, it was specified that the cooled solar panel was approximately 13.69% more efficient than the uncooled one. In this experimental study, uncertainty analysis was also performed. The uncertainty of the maximum power and electrical efficiency are ± 0.16130% and ± 1.28366%, respectively.",

Although liquid filling systems used in industrial production facilities include features that are important for production such as speed, quality, and efficiency, they arise problems in social areas in terms of design, size, economy, and personalized production. In solving the problems, it is realized a special liquid filling system that both meets the needs of people to highly and includes the features of the production systems used in the industry. In the study, a fruit juice filling system that produces fruit juice in the ratio and amount desired by the user using four different juices is proposed. It is thought that when the study done by reducing the need for space with a compact design and increasing the production speed with station-based processes is applied to the private sector, both operating costs are reduced, and end-user demands are met to the desired extent. It is observed that the effect of the cycle time on the unit production time is reduced in the mass production method used in the system, while the cycle time is directly equal to the production time in the private production method. In addition, when the mass production method is used, it is observed that increasing the selection of different fruit juices reduces the production time, as it distributes the filling time to more than one station.",

In the study, a package program based on the finite element method was used. By observing the sample responses such as acceleration and deformation of the tested models, the results were compared and confirmed with previous studies.

In critical processes such as banking, insurance and notary public, the service to be provided remotely has to be provided as quickly and safely as the service provided in presence. In such sensitive processes, the identity card authenticity detection must be done accurately and securely. One of the techniques used in accuracy detection is the use of mobile devices that support contactless chip technology. However, the number of mobile devices using this method is limited today. This situation hinders the effective and widespread use of remotely provided services and resources. Therefore, a different solution method was needed that would be an alternative to contactless chip technology, remove the obstacles to widespread use and reduce incidents such as counterfeiting. In this study, it was investigated whether the hologram, which is one of the security elements in the identity, can be used in determining the accuracy of Turkey's digital identity cards. For this purpose, a special function and program has been developed on the MATLAB application by using 2-D neighborhood methods to detect the crescent on the hologram. 227 digital ID cards were first evaluated on a mobile device over certain threshold values such as color level and similarity ratio. Then, each card used in the test was examined one by one with the naked eye. Approximately 99.56% similar results were obtained between the test findings made over the application and the findings obtained after the controls made with the naked eye. It has been concluded that the secure hologram image, one of the security elements on the digital ID card with this high success rate, can be used as computer aided in remote services. With this solution method, it has contributed to overcome an important obstacle in front of services that are thought to be provided remotely in many fields such as banks, notaries and education.",

This situation produses full adherence acceptance of the steel rebars and concrete interface for use in simple empirical calculations. However, the bond stress-slip model may be important in more realistic and comprehensive models. This situation causes other factors that create adherence to come to the fore, due to the lack of mechanical clamping in smooth surfaced bars. For this reason, it is important to define the bond stress-slip models accurately to the numerical models when constructing the numerical model of this type of rebars. In this study, two reinforced concrete flexural bond experimental test specimens reinforced with smooth surface steel bar and reinforced with sand coated steel bar were prepared. These two prepared samples were tested comparatively in terms of load bearing capacity, vertical displacement capacity, slip and collapse mechanism. As a result of the investigations, boundary values have been proposed for the BPE model, which is also recommended by the CEB FIB model, to be used in both smooth surface and sand-coated surface. In addition to these, numerical models with different embedment lengths were created in the light of experiments and proposed BPE models. It was concluded that the embedment length significantly affects the maximum load capacity in the numerical models created.",

This study presents a new data classification method based on support vector regression and mathematical programming. The proposed method consists of a two-stage hybrid structure. In the first step, the classification score is obtained for each unit with the support vector regression equation. In the second stage, using the classification scores of the units, a classification rule is created with the help of a mathematical model and the classification of the units is provided. The proposed method offers an alternative innovation to traditional methods. Methods based on traditional mathematical programming separate classes with a linear function. This situation limits the use of algorithms based on mathematical programming. The proposed method can be used in all linear or non-linearly separable data structures, as well as easily transforming into problem types with more than two groups. The model is applied to the classification problem of Electroencephalograph (EEG) signals and the classification performance is compared with the existing methods. The results obtained are given in the tables and it is shown that the proposed model can be an alternative to the existing algorithms",

This type of distress can significantly increase the maintenance and rehabilitation costs of pavements. The use of rubber powder or fine granules in certain proportions to the bitumen content can extend the life of the pavements and reduce the environmental problems caused by waste tire disposal. In this study, the fracture behavior of normal and rubber-modified asphalt mixtures was investigated in accordance with AASHTO TP105 by adding waste tire granules at the ratio of 20% by weight of bitumen to hot mix asphalt. It has been determined that when the waste tire powders are added to the hot mix asphalt by replacing 20% of the bitumen weight, coatings with 37% more elastic ability could be made on sustainable pavements. Waste tire powder-mixes performed 118% higher in maximum load and 97% higher in fracture toughness compared to control-mixes. It has been shown that low temperature performance could be improved when waste tire powder-added bitumen processed by dry method is mixed to hot mix asphalt up to 20%.",

In this study, commercially produced PVC profiles were sampled, and a contact angle measurement system, consisting of both software and hardware, was developed to measure the contact angle of the samples. The contact angle measurements were conducted by placing approximately 20 µl of distilled water on the samples, and each sample was measured six times, with the average being taken. A device for measuring roughness was used to determine the surface roughness of the samples, and the average roughness value was obtained from four different parts of each sample. Additionally, SEM images of each sample were taken to conduct surface and structural analyses. The correlation between roughness, SEM image analysis results, and contact angle was examined in the research study. Moreover, the wettability behavior of PVC materials was analyzed by evaluating the impact of the elements in their structure and their homogeneity on the contact angle values.",

Thanks to microfluidic chips, controlled and optimized cell culture studies can be performed with less solution and continuous perfusion. In recent years, culturing the stem cells which has attracted the attention of regenerative medicine, alone or together with other cells and differentiating these cells in the desired direction, are frequently studied in chip systems. Adding hydrogels or decellularized organ matrices to these systems that will mimic the intercellular environment conditions gives results closer to in vivo. There are many studies showing that all the behaviors of the stem cells, including the differentiation, change considerably due to the material from which the chips are produced, the surface modifications, the flow rate, the medium content, the mechano-chemical properties of the hydrogels used, and electrical, chemical or mechanical stimulations. It is predicted that microfluidic chip systems will add a new dimension to personalized medicine, drug toxicity experiments, point-of-care rapid diagnostic kits, and many basic science researches in the future, and will be one of the more reliable and inexpensive potential methods, especially by replacing animal experiments. All these reasons make chip systems the focus of research.

        "abstract": "Forest fires can occur for a variety of reasons and can spread quickly. So it is a big environmental problem. 12 million hectares of land in Turkey, especially in the Aegean and Mediterranean regions, carries a risk of forest fire. Risky areas in forest fire are places where the fire can start easily and spread quickly to other areas. It is difficult to control nature. In this context, the evaluation of the criteria that cause forest fire is discussed in this study. These criteria are topography, vegetation, climate and socioeconomic, which are 4 main criteria. The sub-criteria of these criteria are height, slope, front, dry vegetation, biomass density, temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, distance to settlement, land use, population density and distance to power lines. Therefore, proposing a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) model is invaluable to obtain convincing results, due to the high rate of forest fire. Therefore, Pythagorean Fuzzy (PF) clusters, which offer a wide evaluation scale to the decision maker, PBAHP, Analytical Network Process (AAP) and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methods, which are used in many applications in the studies in the literature, were applied. The criteria that have an impact on forest fire were prioritized using these two methods. Comparative analysis was made with the results obtained and it was shown how important the result was. Then, scenario-based sensitivity analysis was performed and situations in different conditions were observed. Thus, the fire risk status of forested areas was determined by the study. Therefore, it will contribute to the efficient allocation of available resources.",

Agile coaches are not only guiding experts for teams to reveal their full potential, but also have the observation and knowledge to evaluate the current situation. It has been evaluated that Multiple Criteria Decision Making methods can be used to use these qualitative data in the classification of team success. First of all, 23 success criteria were determined by expert evaluations and the weight of each criterion on the success of the team was obtained using the AHP method. Then, since success classification will be made, the success classes of 22 Scrum teams were determined by TOPSIS-sort-B and VIKOR-sort methods. In the study, a classification was obtained according to the success of the Scrum teams and it was aimed to determine the areas of improvement by catching the templates showing the effect of the criteria on the success class.

The prepared RCMP-based cementitious mortars were subjected to flexural and compressive strength tests after being kept in water curing for 7, 28 and 90 days. Microstructure analyzes were carried out on reference and 15% RCMP-based cementitious mortars subjected to water curing for 7 and 90 days. Results reveal that the setting times of cement pastes were prolonged with the increase in the RCMP. In addition, it was determined that the RCMP replacement caused decreases in mechanical properties compared to the reference mortars in the first days, and showed higher mechanical properties compared to the reference mortars in the prolonged days. The microstructure analyzes showed that the hydration developments in the first days were slow with the increase in the RCMP, and the hydration developments of the RCMP substituted cementitious mortars were better than the reference mortars in the prolonged days. As a result, it is recommended to use recycled cement mortar powder up to 25% instead of cement within the scope of the study.",

In order to examine the effects of the fins on the melting process, three different fin widths, 6, 9, and 12 millimeters, were selected. The effects of the fins were analyzed when the difference between the FDM melting temperature and the outer wall temperature of the cylinder was 10, 20, and 30°C. It has been observed that the fins placed in the PCM have a significant effect on the melting process, and the melting time becomes shorter as the fin width increases. The maximum decrease in melting time due to the fin effect was obtained with a fin width of 12 mm at a temperature difference of 10 °C. In this case, while the melting time is 14.8 minutes, the melting time of FDM without fins is 43.5 minutes.",

For this purpose, Marshall designs were applied on the bituminous mixtures created with different aggregate gradations. According to the test results, optimum bitumen requirement of the mixture increased as the aggregate gradation got thinner. It has been determined that as the gradation gets thinner, the void filled with bitumen ratio (Vf) and the percentage of voids in mineral aggregate (VMA) increase, while the unit weight (Dp) decreases at the optimum bitumen ratio.

This value decreased to around -5 dB when there was wet snow on the antenna due to attenuation and thermal effects. If the snow was removed from the antenna, the old S11 value could not be returned because of the wetness left by the snow, and it remained at approximately -14 dB. Consequently, the attenuation of the electromagnetic waves have been confirmed by the literature under different conditions as wet snow with nano VNA for the first time. Attenuation by wet snow and water is greater than dry snow with voids.",

        "abstract": "Thanks to their superior properties such as light weight, higher strength and stiffness, corrosion resistance, the use of plastic matrix composites become attractive in many applications. The weight reduction in the automotive sector is one of these applications. By use of plastic matrix composites, weight and CO2 emission reduction in automobiles could be achieved easily. In this study, carbon fiber and epoxy matrix were processed via filament winding method to produce composite drive shaft. Prior to production, finite element modeling were performed to determine the safest design parameters. Various winding angles were analyzed under torsional loading and number of layer was determined according to the failure index and strength ratio criteria. As a result of the numerical analysis, it was seen that the design with the minimum cost in terms of strength was the 10-layer model with a winding angle of +/- 45 degrees. To validate the design, the composite shaft was produced with the determined configurations and tested. The fiber volume fraction and the void content of the produced composite were found as ~46% was ~0.28%, respectively. No plastic deformation was observed in the torsion test. In the flattening and drift-expansion tests, plastic deformation occurred at 39 kN and 106.5 kN, respectively. Compared with a steel shaft, the obtained composite shaft has an 80% reduction in weight, and this could lead to a 1% fuel saving in passenger vehicles.",

By using these parameters, pneumatic trail, tyre contact area pressure distribution, tyre contact area maximum pressure value, lateral tyre deflection, and cornering stiffness were calculated. Similarly, for certain values of camber angle, camber thrust, and camber stiffness were examined.

The problem of assigning the products (tasks) that a firm has to supply to its sub-industries considering more than one period is an example of B-MRGAP. In this problem, any change in product demands will also change the resource consumption amounts of the tasks in the sub-industries. Since changes in production quantities are common in many sectors, handling resource consumption quantities as stochastic rather than deterministic will lead to more realistic solutions. In this study, resource consumption amounts in B-MRGAP are handled as stochastic. To solve this problem, a two-stage stochastic programming model has been developed. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by using randomly generated test problems. When the test results were examined, it was seen that even in small-sized problems, handling the problem stochastically made a contribution. In addition, it was revealed that the contribution increased as the number of agents, the number of tasks, and the resource consumption variability increased.",

Single foundations are one of the most common types of foundations traditionally required to support buildings in earthquake-prone regions. Most researchers work on the dynamic interaction between the foundation and the soil, which can affect the response of the building during earthquakes due to the type of earthquake and the properties of the soil layer. In this paper, four different earthquakes were applied to a reinforced concrete building constructed in two-layer soils with very different soil properties, and a discussion on soil-structure interaction was opened using Abaqus software. In the analysis, a layered soil is simulated with 4 different models (soft-hard, hard-soft). Through these analyses, the influence of the different soil layers (soft and hard), the building displacement and the frequency content of the earthquake were studied. According to the result of the analysis, it is important to consider the earthquake characteristics, the soil properties, and the type of foundation in the dynamic soil-structure interaction.",

Under the same conditions, results taken from the wireless experiments performed for three different set points were compared. To achieve the data transfer between computer in Process Control Laboratory and the simulator in Unit Operations Laboratory, wireless communication system established. Wireless experiments were performed on-line by means of MATLAB/Simulink program. Wireless data transfers during the experiments were carried out using radio waves at a frequency of 2.4 GHz. For the dynamics experiments performed employing Cohen-Coon and Ziegler-Nichols methods, the process reaction curve was prepared using step change effect. The dead time, time constant and gain values were determined as 33s, 367s and 0.4, respectively. KC, τI, τd coefficients are determined by Cohen-Coon as 37.7, 78.3s, 11.8s, respectively. Comparing the experimental results performed at different set points, one could see that the heater works irregularly and on-off form during the experiments. It is noted that the coefficients obtained with this method are not effective for temperature control. The KC, τI, τd parameters are determined by the Ziegler-Nichols method as 0.412, 66.0, 16.5s, respectively. In this control case, the temperature followed the desired set point with 1 °C offset. By using trial and error method, KC, τI, τd parameters are obtained as 0.21, 20.0, 4.5s, respectively. By this control method, temperature followed the desired set point without any offset and wireless temperature control was achieved successfully for different set points",

In recent years, Tool Condition Monitoring (TCM) systems that generate excitation signals about the state of cutting tools and warn the operator before tool fracture have been used widely in industrial area and the modern machine tools have become equipped with these systems. Therefore, a detection model using acoustic emission signals and cutting force signals have been developed for TCM, prediction of the tool fracture moment and minimizing the operator’s interference to the tool. During cutting operations at different cutting parameters, the variation of AE signals and force signals have been monitored graphically by means of the experimental set-up prepared and software written and the recorded signals also have been evaluated to decide about tool condition",

Generally, the roof covers the building as an umbrella although it completes the building/structure concept and is also a main structural system from an architectural point of view. Particularly, the roof shape and the dimensions are of importance during the design stage of the building. It gives attractive figure to the building in terms of beauty. When dimensioning, cross-section of roof load bearing elements should be designed in such a way that building code regulations have to be met; and these should be indicated on the roof project. Building controllers or associations should inspect the building according to the building code of practice as well as the system of roof structure. In this study, widespread roof damages due to the 17 August Marmara earthquake and the recommendations to prevent from such damages are given for the buildings in Adapazari city centre. It is outlined that the code of practice has not been taken into account for the construction of timber roof system; the connection between the timber elements have not been tightly fitted into each other; cross-section of timber elements have not been used according to the standards; and care has not been given for the timber roof structure",

In the optimization studies carried out with the L-BFGS-B algorithm and Emperor Penguin algorithm, the values of temperature (T), oxygen pressure (p(O2)), hydrogen pressure (p(H2)), and water vapor pressure (p(H2O)) are calculated for minimum voltage while the input values of Faraday constant, Gas constant, Activation polarization coefficient, Reverse current density, and Electrode thickness are fixed. For both optimization methods, the optimum temperature value is calculated as 1000 K, the optimum oxygen pressure value as 1.0, the optimum hydrogen pressure value as 0.000001, and the optimum water vapor pressure value as 0.000001. The minimum cell voltage was calculated as 0.6486 for both optimization methods, but the L-BFGS-B algorithm reached the result in 6 iterations and 0.0046 seconds, while the Emperor Penguin algorithm reached it in 44 iterations and 0.01 seconds.

During design phase, it is aimed to keep this movement below a certain threshold. For this aim, numerous experimental and numerical studies have been conducted to accurately predict seepage. In recent years, probabilistic analyses incorporating variations in soil properties have been increasingly employed, particularly with the aim of reducing uncertainties in calculations. Finite element methods are frequently employed in these probabilistic analyses. In this study, probabilistic seepage analyses were conducted using the finite element method, considering uncertainties in the permeability values of the core material. Two hypothetical embankment dams with different core slopes were designed for the study. Initially, the statistical parameters of permeability values for the clay core were determined, and permeabilities generated through Monte Carlo simulations were employed as inputs for PLAXIS 2D analyses. Results from both models with the same mean permeability were compared with each other and with the deterministically obtained results. Generally, the study reveals lower seepage values through probabilistic analysis compared to those obtained with deterministic methods. Furthermore, the impact of the assumed probabilistic distribution parameters of the soil variability on the final outcome was explicitly illustrated.",

In the first stage, the situation with the highest number of problem assumptions was evaluated in accordance with the general form of the cluster coverage model. In the second stage, solutions were made according to the scenarios with the possibility that the base station would be affected by external factors and the coverage area would decrease.

Scaffolds must have the necessary qualities to create an optimal architecture for cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation in order to form tissue. However, constrained structural designs and outdated manufacturing procedures impede the enhancement of scaffold qualities. To address these restrictions, researchers are merging computer-aided scaffold design with 3D printing processes during production. This method permits the design and manufacture of scaffolds with extremely intricate microstructures. The literature shows that computer-aided design combined with 3D printing technology is often utilized to design and manufacture nerve guide conduits for nerve regeneration. In this study, three different nerve guide conduit structures were designed and produced. Two of them are based on triple periodic minimal surfaces derived from Gyroid, schwarz. Although triple periodic minimal surfaces used as the basis for scaffold designs offer promising advantages for tissue engineering applications, limited information is available regarding their manufacturability. The designs created in this study, as well as their fabrication, will add to the literature on the manufacturability of triple periodic minimum surfaces.",

        "abstract": "A software project schedule management tool is essential for monitoring the project duration and budget, two key factors that will directly affect project success. Assignment of personnel for tasks, initiation order of tasks, task completion time, possible delays in starting a task, and money already spent and the remaining budget are tracked via the software project tool. This study aims to provide software project managers with a powerful tool to solve the Resource-Constrained Software Project Scheduling Problem (RCSPSP) with minimum project duration, minimum project budget, and minimum waiting time of tasks. For this purpose, a hybrid approach is used in this study, in which the Genetic Algorithm (GA) is supported by Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO), Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) and chaotic logistic map. The pack hierarchy model in GWO is used to contribute to the convergence success of GA, and scout bee methodology in ABC is adopted into the method to avoid being trapped at local minima. The chaotic logistic map technique is also used to improve randomness. The developed hybrid method has been tested with datasets in the Intelligent Multi-Objective Project Scheduling Environment (iMOPSE). The results are compared with in literature algorithms and statistically analyzed using non-parametrik tests. According to test results, an improvement of up to 7% in the one employee assignment model and up to 15% in the multiemployee assignment model has been observed. The results show that the method has good and competitive performance in terms of solution stability and closeness to optimal solutions.",

These products have high biogas potential when evaluated in energy production. Many studies, both experimental and theoretical, have been carried out to detect this potential. While carrying out these studies, some assumptions are made and some variables are ignored. For this reason, it is possible to obtain accurate results with calculations made using criteria when determining the biogas potential of energy plants. The aim of this study is to determine the energy plant with the highest biogas potential in Turkey using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). In the analytical hierarchy process, the criteria were determined as \"The amount of waste required to produce 1 m3 of methane (CH4)\", \"Sales Price of Waste\", \"Area Where Plants Are Cultivated in Turkey\", \"Energy Efficiency\" and \"Product-Specific Amount of Evaluable Waste\". The alternatives of the study were chosen as \"Cotton\", \"Sunflower\", \"Wheat\", \"Barley\" and \"Corn\". As a result of the study, Wheat Straw was determined as the best alternative with 0.374 points. According to these results, the best energy plant in Turkey was defined as wheat straw. The total biogas potential of this plant in Turkey is calculated as 156x106 m3 and the electrical energy potential of this biogas was 733.2x106 kWh/year.",

Argon (Ar) and argon mixed with a mole fraction of 5% hydrogen (Ar/H2) gas medium are seperately introduced into the micro gap at sub-atmospheric pressure of 150 Torr, and the cell is driven at 1.0 kV DC by a stationary power source to simulate the transitions from electron field emission state toward self-sustained normal glow discharge state.The model is simulated to exhibit the transient physical characteristics of the AlGaSb-Ar/H2 glow-discharge micro plasma system by solving the spatio-temporal dynamics of various discharge parameters, including electron density, electron energy density, electron current density and electric potential.

In this study, a mathematical model that is easily understandable and applicable by decision-makers has been created for this complex problem. Possible future operational scenarios have been identified as alternatives using the Value-Focused Thinking (VFT) method based on the values of decision-makers by creating a hierarchy of criteria including the size, duration, environment, scope, and type of operation. These alternatives have emerged and been analyzed as Operations Against Equivalent Countries, Counter-Terrorism Operations, Support Operations for Friendly Countries, Joint Operations, NATO Operations, Embargo, Energy Crisis, Food Crisis, Drought, and Contagious Disease. Among these alternatives, Operations Against Equivalent Countries (0.74), Counter-Terrorism Operations (0.71), and Embargo (0.67) ranking have formed the top three scenarios by having the top scoring. Additionally, a graphical representation has been made of the probabilities of occurrence for the scenarios (alternatives) identified using VFT, as well as the potential impact levels of these scenarios. This representation forms the most crucial step in enabling decision-makers to make more effective, efficient, and economical decisions in defense planning. This study is of great importance as it represents the use of VFT for future-oriented scenario analysis in defense planning for the first time.",

In this study, the dynamic characteristics of a shaft-hydrodynamic journal bearing and its stability were investigated under variable viscosity. The equations of lubricant flow were derived by Dowson’s equation under variable viscosity, and the perturbation equations were obtained for 2 degrees-of-freedom system. The heat transfers between oil and the journal surface was modelled in a 3-dimensional energy equation, and the heat transfer on the journal structure was also modelled with heat conduction equation. An algorithm based on finite difference scheme with successive over relaxation method was developed to solve the theoretical models, simultaneously, and a serial simulation was performed to investigate the variations of the dynamic coefficients of the bearing-shaft system concerning the rotating speed for different radial clearance values. It was determined that the high speed increases the lubricant temperature, and so the static and dynamic performance characteristics decrease, moreover, this effect is more dominant for the smaller radial clearance.",

Machining experiments were conducted to develop the prediction models. Three levels of control factors of cutting speed (m/min), cutting depth (mm) and feed rate (mm/rev) were used in the experiments. The developed models were validated with experimental measurements and their performance was evaluated.

The SUMO (Simulation of Urban Mobility) simulation platform was used in the implementation. The calculation results have shown that, compared to the current situation, the delay time decreased by approximately 32% and 42% with the Webster-based ACA and Modified Webster-based ACA methods, respectively.

        "abstract": "From past to present, Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers stand out as the most widely used types of controllers. Due to the high-performance requirements, experimentally determined controller coefficients necessitate the application of modern optimization techniques. In this study, Ziegler-Nichols, Chien-Hrones-Reswick, and Cohen-Coon methods, which allow parameter calculation through the open-loop system's step response method, were compared with the Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm for PID controllers designed for a brush-commutated DC motor with unknown parameters in the Matlab environment. The comparison was based on Integral of Absolute Error (IAE), Integral of Square Error (ISE), Integral of Time-weighted Absolute Error criterion. Similarly, the performance of the Cuckoo Algorithm was discussed in terms of stability margins and stability peaks. In this comparison, it was observed that the PID controller optimized with the Cuckoo Algorithm operated with high proportional and integral coefficients to minimize the cost function, resulting in overshoot in the system response. Input shaping, a commonly used method in open-loop control of both brushed and brushless DC motor systems, was integrated into the system to mitigate this overshoot. The hybrid controller achieved the best performance in terms of IAE, ISE and ITAE in the system response, with less overshoot compared to the other mentioned methods.",

        "abstract": "The integration of IoT-enabled smart technologies into our daily lives offers numerous benefits in many ways; however, it has also given rise well-founded security concerns since the protocols designed for IoT networks, enabling this technology, exhibit numerous vulnerabilities today. One such protocol is the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low Power Lossy Networks (RPL) which is frequently used in IoT networks to enable routing between the heterogeneous devices. RPL has exhibited significant shortcomings and has become a target for various attacks up to now. Evaluating the performance of RPL attacks is a non-trivial task for securing IoT network effectively. Although performance analysis studies are numerous in literature, all of them rely on ‘human-crafted’ attack environments. In contrast, this study considers the most challenging malicious environments achievable for performance evaluation. To achieve such environments, the use of genetic algorithm is explored in this study. The findings reveal that the impact of the attack is greatly influenced by the position as well as the density of the attackers in the network.",

In-cylinder pressure, heat release rate, start of combustion, CA50, combustion duration, indicated thermal efficiency, maximum pressure rise rate analysis were done and hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions were determined. In lean mixing conditions, the pressure and heat release rate in the cylinder decreased with all test fuels. The addition of tetrahydrofuran to the reference n-heptane fuel enabled the combustion processes to be controlled. The maximum indicated thermal efficiency was obtained as 38.14 % at 1.9 lambda with THF60 fuel. Addition of tetrahydrofuran to n-heptane fuel slowed down the combustion. Thus, low temperature combustion was completed in a longer period. Under extremely lean operating conditions, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions of n-heptane-tetrahydrofuran fuel mixtures increased compared to the reference fuel. The highest pollutant emissions have been achieved with THF60 fuel. Compared to the reference fuel, hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide increased by an average of 8.3 % and 54 %.",

Therefore, hydrogen gas is regarded as one of the major energy sources it has gone beyond just a promise alternative energy source of energy. However, hydrogen gas is explosive, and it can cause a massive conflagration. Since this gas has no color, smell, and taste, highly sensitive gas sensor that can detect a minimal amounts of hydrogen gas must be installed for safety. An explosion can occur when the gas concentration is above 4%; for this reason, sensors that can detect ppm scale hydrogen gas must be developed.In this study, 1% and 2% Tungten (W) doped ZnO thin films were grown by chemical bathing technique and Hydrogen gas (H2) sensing properties were investigated. Electrical characterization of the samples at different temperatures (30 ° C-160 ° C) and different gas concentrations (5 ppm-100 ppm) was performed. The operating temperature was found at 100 C. The sensors exhibited acceptable sensitivity to 5 ppm H2 gas. 1% W-doped ZnO thin film showed higher sensing performance than other thin films at 100 ° C . 1 % W-doped ZnO thin film exhibited 28.56 % sensitivity to 5 ppm H2 gas, while the 2 % W-doped ZnO thin film exhibited 7% sensitivity.

In this study finish hard turning was performed on the AISI 420 stainless steel using ceramic and coated carbide inserts under dry cutting conditions. Depth of cut, feed rate, and cutting speed were selected as machining parameters, while surface roughness was chosen as machinability criterion. Taguchi L9 orthogonal array was selected for the design of the experiment to decrease the number of trials for reducing time and cost of manufacturing. The response surface methodology was utilized for determining a relationship among process parameters and output parameter. The analysis of variance results indicates that feed rate is the utmost factor on the surface roughness for both ceramic and carbide inserts with 86.56% and 80.57% contribution, respectively. The developed mathematical models for ceramic and coated carbide inserts are capable to predict surface roughness with 97.07% and 96.13% accuracy, respectively. Based on the desirability function and response optimizer of the RSM, 0.2 mm depth of cut, 250 m/min cutting speed, and 0.05 mm/rev feed rate were selected as optimum machining factors.

        "abstract": "In urban transportation, trains have an increasingly important place due to the increase in the number of passengers. Meeting the number of passengers is directly related to the number of trains operated on a line. Thus, the frequency of operation of trains affects the level of wear of the equipment. This makes train maintenance more important. Equipment faults are the basis for train maintenance. However, the fault times of the equipment which are unknown causes uncertainty in the maintenance activities and plans. This uncertainty results from many factors that affect the faults of the train. If historical maintenance data, fault data, and factors affecting the faults are known, effective use of resources (time, cost and personnel, etc.) is provided and uncertainty is eliminated. In this study, firstly, maintenance data in Ankara Metro between 2017 and 2018 is examined and the factors affecting equipment faults are evaluated with expert opinion. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model is created with the data set and this data set along with the factors affecting each the equipment fault according to the type of equipment. In the ANN model, 5 factors (Equipment Type, Preventive Maintenance Frequency, Material Quality, Life Cycle, Line Status) affecting the faults of the equipment is determined as inputs and the number of failures as outputs. The mean absolute percent error (MAPE) value is found as 11%, and the mean square error value (MSE) is 0.0028229 in the training and test stages of ANN. Then, the frequency of fault is found according to the equipment fault and a 10-week maintenance planning is applied. The results are compared with current maintenance planning. As a result of the applied maintenance planning, the average number of faults of the trains decreases by 27%, uninterrupted service rate increases by 40% and heavy maintenance errors are also prevented. Fault removal times resulted in a 10% improvement. The results showed that ANN models could be used effectively in fault prediction and maintenance planning with rail system multiple types of equipment. In the literature, there is no study that implements maintenance planning with an ANN model where all train equipments and factors affecting the failure are evaluated together. This study is the first in the field of rail systems maintenance in the literature and will be a reference for future studies.",

Concerns about the sustainability of lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries, which are the most widely used of secondary batteries, and the limited lithium reserves around the world have accelerated scientific studies on next-generation energy storage systems. At this point, sodium-ion (Na-ion) batteries, which can be used as an alternative to Li-ion batteries, stand out as highly promising electrochemical energy storage devices. However, many characteristics such as energy density, power density and cyclic stability have to be improved for commercialization of such batteries. The production process and electrochemical performance of each Na-ion battery component are highly dependent on the structure-property relationship and production conditions of these materials. Therefore, determining the relationship between the structural properties of each component such as the anode and their electrochemical performance together with designing the best performing structures are critical for the development of Na-ion batteries. Although intensive and promising studies have been conducted on the use of low-cost and sustainable materials in the anodes of Na-ion batteries, carbon-based materials, which can have different graphitization degree and morphological charecteristics, and their composites often stand out among different material groups. The aim of this study is to create a theoretical basis for the usability of different carbon materials in the anodes of Na-ion batteries with the current literature findings.",

Workability was kept fixed in all paste and mortar mixtures. On the paste mixtures, consistency water, initial and final setting times and soundness were tested. 40x40x160 mm prism samples were produced with the prepared mortar mixtures. Unit weight, flexural strength and compressive strength tests were carried out at the age of 7, 28 and 90 days on the hardened mortar samples. As a result; it was determined that the increase in the amount of slaked lime entering the paste mixtures increased the amount of consistency water, relatively decreased of initial setting time, increased of final setting time and decreased the soundness. On the other hand, the increase in the slaked lime; it was determined that the mortars reduced the unit weight, flexural strength and compressive strength.",

Since trajectory data is considered as personal data, attackers may obtain sensitive information about their victims and perform disclosure attacks if the trajectory data is published in original form. There is always a need for up-to-date privacy preserving approaches to address this problem. In this study, in order to publish privacy preserved trajectory data, a new anonymization model based on differential privacy was proposed, developed and successfully tested.

In this context, it is a necessity to plan the revision maintenance analytically for effective portfolio management. Within this scope, although the maintenance scheduling problem of more than one power plant or unit is frequently discussed in the literature, calendar with maintenance to be performed during certain periods of the year produced by these studies is not always applicable in terms of the system dynamics and constraints of Turkey's electricity generation system. The main need is to manage the portfolios by keeping the power plants available and knowing the revision maintenance priorities that require long-term stoppages in order to both increase portfolio profitability and contribute to energy supply security. In this context, in this study, revision maintenance prioritization problem of 12 units at 3 different power plants is discussed in one of the large-scale natural gas combined cycle power plant portfolio for the first time in the literature. This study, which seeks a solution to the problem with multi-criteria decision-making approaches, is the first study in the literature to realize revision maintenance planning with long-term stoppages that affect the energy supply security at the highest level, rather than planning narrow-scoped periodic maintenance.",

Firstly, the electrical efficiency of all samples under Standard Test Conditions was tested by a sun simulator. Efficiency values were between 12.56% and 12.68% under STC. Furthermore, outdoor tests were carried out to investigate the effect of temperature on PV modules in ambient conditions using PV/T samples. In order to determine the efficiency of the units, parameters such as solar irradiation, voltage and current values, inlet and outlet water temperature and flow rate of PV/T modules and ambient temperature were measured. It was observed that the electrical performance of PV/T modules was higher than that of the PV module due to the cooling effect of water circulation over the cells.

As cutting parameters in machining experiments, three different cutting speeds (75, 100, 125 m/min), three different feed rates (0.16 - 0.25 - 0.5 mm/rev), three different MQL flow rates (0.35 - 0.8 - 1.7 ml/min) and a constant depth of cut (2.5 mm) were selected.

Nano fluids have a concentration of 2% by weight. The experimental setup consists of two overlapping air ducts. In the middle of the two ducts, there are 5 bundles of copper heat pipes perpendicular to the ducts.. The air passing through the lower duct is heated with 4 units of 1000 Watt heaters. The air in the upper duct cools the heat pipes and condenses the fluid in the heat pipe.. The experiments were carried out at 2 cold air flow rate, 3 hot air flow rate and 2 heating power. In all experiments, it has been observed that nanofluids provide better thermal efficiencies than pure water. Better thermal efficiency values were achieved than the other two fluids in CuO + Fe / Pure water nano fluid experiments. In CuO / Pure water nano fluid experiments, the highest efficiency increase was 68% compared to pure water. In CuO + Fe / Pure water nano fluid experiments the highest efficiency increase was 87% compared to pure water. These recovery rates were realized when the air flows in cold and hot channels were 0.75 m / s and 0.7 m / s, respectively. In addition, the use of CuO / Pure water and CuO + Fe / Pure water nano fluids instead of  pure water has reduced the thermal resistance of heat pipes.

The components which effect to ship’s speed are wind, wave and sea current direction and magnitudes. In this study, we recommend a weather routing system which gets sea and weather forecasts from Inmarsat and Copernicus services and calculates alternative optimal routes for any voyage in the Aegean Sea. CSGA (Cuckoo Search Genetic Algorithm) is used for calculation. Firstly, the shortest paths between the ports were calculated and stored without considering the sea and weather conditions. After getting the forecasts from Inmarsat and Copernicus services, the cost of the shortest path was calculated and proposed algorithm tried to find a better route to minimize the sailing time and fuel consumption. Because, the Aegean Sea ports are not so far from each other, under calm sea and weather conditions, no better routes than the shortest path routes were found. But, in rough sea and weather conditions in winter, the system could find alternatives way to reduce the sailing time and fuel consumption.",

The digital printing system, which is increasing its effectiveness today, has taken great steps with technology since the first years of its existence and has started to have a voice in the sector for the last ten years. The digital printing, which is an alternative to the offset printing system in making design a product, exhibits significant improvements in terms of production efficiency, cost and quality. Offset has become competitive with flexo printing with the developing color efficiency in digital printing machines. High quality and different applications can be made with digital printing machines. In order to achieve this (screening) process, it is necessary to know the boundaries of the color universe that can be seen or produced by the devices and machines used in the system. In this study, the difference between colors and color consistency and basic measurements such as color values, dot gain were evaluated by changing the selection of screen methods used in digital printing. The differences caused by the screening structure variable have been shown with graphics and tables, then suggestions have been made. It has been determined that the change in the screening structures in digital printing creates differences in dot swelling, density and color.",

In addition, by using these nanofluids, the surface tension of the working fluid is reduced, reducing the thermal resistance of the heat pipe, increasing the heat conduction amount even at very low temperature differences between the evaporator and condenser regions, and thus increasing the heat pipe performance. The heat pipe used in the study is a 1 m long copper pipe with an internal and external diameter of 13 mm and 15 mm, respectively, positioned at an angle of 90°. The 400 mm part of the heat pipe constitutes the condensation zone, the 400 mm part constitutes the evaporation region and the remaining 200 mm part is the adiabatic region. In the experimental study carried out, it was filled with 65 ml of work fluid, corresponding to 1/3 of the evaporator volume of the heat pipe. Experiments were carried out separately for water and nanofluids, and the results obtained were compared. The Reynolds number value was 8800 and the hot air speed was 0,555m / s, while the highest recovery rate for both CuO/water and ZnO/water nanofluids was 71.8% and 52.9%, respectively.

A mathematical simulation model has been developed for louvered fin MCHEs where the working fluid is R600a, which estimates the outlet temperature, total heat transfer capacity and entropy generation of the R600a. To imrpove the accuracy of the model, different mass velocities in the passes and uniform air velocities at the face of MCHE have been taken into consideration in the proposed model. Different from other models in the literature, a calculation system created by two discretization level has been applied to take into account these effects. Non-uniform air velocities have been taken into consideration via dividing the face of the MCHE into airflow regions in the model. Experimental study has been performed to validate the model results. It concluded that the model predicts the outlet temperature with an average absolute deviation within ±10% for all investigated test conditions. It is found that the taking into consideration non-uniform air velocity improves accuracy of the model.  The entropy generation mechanisms in the MCHE have been investigated and it has been determined that the contribution of the fluid flow irreversibility to entropy generation is quite low compared to heat transfer irreversibility.",

These are friction welding (FW), friction-stir welding (FSW), ultrasonic welding, chemical bonding, and hot plate welding. Rotary friction welding (RFW) method, which is one of the FW methods, is generally used in joining the filter parts of water treatment devices. After RFW processes, semi-melted plastic accumulations tend to occur on the interior surfaces of the filter parts. In some cases, particles broken off from these accumulations can often clog sensitive filters. In this study, it is aimed to develop a welding joint profile design that can be used to confine the semi-melted agglomeration formed in the interior surfaces of the filter parts. For this purpose, the semi-melted agglomeration in the filter parts is analyzed/simulated utilizing the ABAQUS program by using Lagrangian and CEL (Coupled Eulerian-Lagrangian) methods, and their thermal analysis, stress, and energy data are evaluated. The analysis is repeated until the optimal welding structure design to confine the semi-melted agglomeration is developed. As a result of the analyses, it was determined that the maximum temperature reached is 166.2 °C, there was a 1.98 mm shortening in the length of the product after welding, and the temperature of 150 °C was reached in 13.1 milliseconds. From the several joint profile designs proposed, it was determined that the N3 joint profile design accommodates the semi-melt raw material better than the others.",

In this study, the performance of stone columns in loose, saturated sandy soils was investigated with a three dimensional finite element model. In the analysis, both pore water pressure ratios and settlement results were compared for soils with and without stone columns. Also a parametric study is carried out to see how changes in stone column parameters affect stone column performance. A three-dimensional two-phase element (u20p8) implemented to ANSYS program to make the usage of hypoplastic material model possible, in order to obtain pore water pressure accumulations that may occur under dynamic loading in saturated soils. It is seen that the model is well suited for the examination of the behaviour of granular soils under repeated loading.

The data of the transmission-reflection spectra of 25, 40, 50, and 60 °C temperatures of these FBGs were transferred to the Optisystem 17 software in the appropriate format and the study was maintained over Optisystem 17. The spectrum behavior and shifts occurring at the wavelengths for each temperature range of the broadband laser source examined at the input of the FBG were examined with an optical spectrum analyzer. These phases were repeated for the uniform, apodized and chirped FBGs designed. It was observed that the sensors in the uniform, apodized and chirped structures designed exhibited different spectra from each other due to their properties.",

The stress-shielding effect, which occurs as a result of remarkable strength difference from solid materials to bone, causes loss of biomedical implants. Porous materials can be designed according to conditions with advantages of additive manufacturing and manufacturing can be made by copying natural geometries. In the study, the geometries obtained by copying the trabecular bones taken from femur and vertebra regions of a sheep by Micro-CT compared to studies on reproducibility and strength of designable unit cell geometries in the literature were produced by selective laser melting from Ti6Al4V ELI alloy. Compression and compression-shear strengths of samples were examined. The elasticity module was obtained from the compression tests and found 3±0.25 GPa on the femur samples and 2±0.15 GPa on the vertebra samples. It was found that the compatibility of finite element analysis with the test results was admirable. As the trabecular metal takes its geometry from bone structure, it is concluded that it is an interface material with high fusion capability for biomedical products by supporting bone inward growth behavior and decreasing stress shielding effect.",

In the Roman period, many marble quarries were opened due to the need for quality marble in important monumental buildings. One of these quarries is Docimium (Iscehisar-Afyonkarahisar) marble quarry. Fine-grained white (Afyon cream) and purplish-red colored (Afyon violet) marbles were extracted from this quarry. These marbles were sent from the port of Ephesus to many Roman cities and were used in many monumental and important buildings during the Roman period. In this study, Afyon violet (Pavonazzetto) marble, which has been of international importance since ancient times, was investigated. In the first stage, the importance of Afyon violet marble in the Roman period was explained and in the second stage the characterization study was made. For this purpose, chemical, mineralogical-petrographic (polarized microscope, XRD, SEM), physical and mechanical tests / analyzes were performed. In the third stage, the durability of Afyon violet (Pavonazzetto) marble was evaluated with the help of salt crystallization and freeze-thaw experiments. According to the experimental data, after the salt crystallization and freeze-thaw experiments, the ultrasonic wave velocity decreased by 23,83% and 13,3%, uniaxial compressive strength values decreased by 15,97% and 20,11%, respectively in the marble samples. It has been determined that the deterioration in the brecciated structure of the marble is caused by mica minerals such as phlogopite, muscovite and clay (illite) minerals.",

This study covers a NACA 0009 profiled wing with a 111 mm span and chord and its CFD analysis using Ansys version 15.0. Three-dimensional analysis has been done using Ansys Fluent. A geometry was created, this geometry was meshed properly, tighter especially close to the wings, and its analysis was completed using the k-w turbulence model. In total 2,078,272 nodes and 2,036,295 elements have been formed in the mesh. Four different angles of attack have been tested which are 0°, 5°, 10° and 15° at 37,000 Reynolds number. Generated mesh has an average skewness rate of 1.3 and an average orthogonal quality rate of 0.97. Velocity contours and streamlines have been compared to the literature. Lift and drag coefficients have been monitored. As the angle of attack increases, it is seen that shocks form at the trailing edge especially at 15° angle of attack and therefore aerodynamic performance of the NACA 0009 at different angles has been tested. With a L/D ratio of 10.03, the 5° angle of attack have been prevailed in comparisons.",

The negative environmental effects and limited amounts of fossil fuels have led to increased demand for renewable energy sources worldwide and the production of various models and devices has accelerated to take advantage of solar energy, which is the basis of all energy sources. Using solar collectors as a way to benefit from solar energy has been used for many years. Although solar collectors are generally divided into 4 types as flat plate (FPSC), evacuated tube (ETSC), parabolic (PSC) and heat pipe (HPSC), these types can also be divided into separate types with many different features. The most commonly used solar collector type in the world is Flat Plate Solar Collector. The most important reasons for this are being cheap, easily produced and applied in various ways. Yet, the thermal productivity of FPSCs decreases below 40% in non-ideal climate conditions with low surrounding temperature. The existence of such disadvantages of FPSCs led to the production of Evacuated Tube Solar Collectors. With the advancing technology, the utilization of heat pipes in collectors has come to the agenda and as a result of the studies conducted, it has been determined that the use of heat pipe improves efficiency. In addition, the use of nanofluids in solar collectors and heat pipes has become quite common, and many studies have been carried out especially on this subject recently. The primary objective is always to improve the performance of the system and achieve efficiency. In this way, solar energy will be used in the most effective way and world energy supply demand will be met by using renewable resources.",

While MPPT is performed in uniformly distributed radiation conditions, one of the traditional algorithms, perturb and observe (P&O) algorithm is very efficient. However, when partial shading conditions occur, this algorithm cannot find global maximum power points and caught to local maximum power points. In contrast, nature inspired metaheuristic algorithms such as particle swarm optimization (PSO) and cuckoo search optimization (CSO) algorithm are more successful in finding the global maximum.In this study, a system consisting of photovoltaic array, DC-DC boost converter and load has been developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK. Using this system, MPPT was performed with P&O, PSO and CSO algorithms under partial shading conditions and comparative analysis of these algorithms was performed. These algorithms were compared with three different partial shading configurations for tracking time and accuracy. As a result of the simulations, the P&O algorithm caught to a local point, while the PSO and CSO algorithms were successful in finding the global point. When PSO and GKO algorithm are compared, it is seen that CSO algorithm reaches global point faster than PSO algorithm.",

Many parameters can affect the quality and homogeneity of the graphene film that is grown with this technique. In this study, two growth parameters which are methane flow rate and growth time were investigated to find out their effect on the quality of the graphene film, which is grown on nickel foil. Graphene film grown with different flow rates of methane (from 20 to 50 sccm) and growth time (50 to 20 mins.) were examined. We found that single layer graphene film could only be grown under 20 sccm methane flow in 20 mins. growth time as evidenced via Raman spectroscopy measurements. Furthermore, the single layer graphene film was found to be in high homogeneity as confirmed by Raman mapping. On the other hand, multi-layer graphene film was obtained by increasing both methane flow and growth time.",

Body weight (BW) and muscle forces were applied to the first metatarsal bone. The bone was fixed at the proximal region of the bone for the boundary conditions. Three evaluation criteria were examined for the results as the stresses, the total deformations and the strain values on the bone. The stress and strain distributions of the bone were evaluated for the bone failure. The deformation of the bone were evaluated for the bone stabilitiy. As a result, the wearing HHS increases the stress values on the first metatarsal bone approximately %54 compared to the flat shoes. The strain values showed that the bone crack or failure was not occured. The deformation of the bone was increased when wearing the HHS shoes. The conclusion of the study is that the wearing HHS negatively affects the first metatarsal bone. Hence, the frequency of the wearing HHS in daily life should be reduced and heeled shoe designs should be made taking into account the stresses occured on the bone.",

Due to this reason, increasing the flexibility of thermal power plants is examined under 4 main headings: Working under minimum load, fast load ramp up/down, start-up procedure optimization and primary and secondary support capabilities. As a result of the 4 different studies in the flexibility categories, the power plant has been successful without exceeding the limit values. The minimum load value which was previously determined as % 40 was revised to % 30, the primary and secondary frequency tests were also successful and the load ramp up/down values were improved to 20MW/min.

Firstly, gain and noise figure values of single and double pass EDFAs are measured while input signal power is varied from -40 dBm to +5 dBm at the 1554 nm wavelength. Then, measurements are repeated while wavelength values of input signal are varied from 1526 nm to 1570 nm at the -30 dBm signal power. Consequently, the gain of double pass EDFA is improved by about 3-9 dB. However, the noise figure is increased to about 2-5 dB due to the amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) power propagates both forward and backward along the fiber at the double pass EDFA",

North Anatolian Fault Zone was a length of 105 km in length and approximately passes through in a distance of 30 km in the South of study area (Kaytazdere District). It was predicated to affect the region and create the biggest peak horizontal accelaration due to earthquake. In a probable earthquake effect, it was calculated an earthquake of moment magnitude as MW=6.9, considering that North Anatolian Fault Zone may be cracked 1/3 of the total length. Using attenuation relationships developed for Turkey a peak ground acceleration of 0.48g was calculated for the study site. According to the these results, the liquefaction analysis was performed using the SPT data and two locations were determined as liquefiable",

For this purpose, test samples were impregnated with two different methods according to ASTM-D 1413 standards. In the first method, full cell method, for an hour the wood materials were vacuumed for an hour and then they were impregnated under 4 atm for an hour. As for the second method, they were immersed in boron oil for an hour. The results of the experiments show that the highest amount of retention ratio and densities were observed in beech samples. In mechanical strength, the highest bending strength, modulus of elasticity, compression strength and dynamic bending strength were obtained in beech control samples. In conclusion, the wood material should be impregnated by pressure method if waste boron oil is to be used in the fields which will be exposed to physical pressure. Moreover, waste boron oil caused decreasing the mechanical properties as 2% or 5%. However, it is determined that this result is not important for properties of wood materials. According to this wood material could be impregnated by dipping method if it is to be used in the fields which will be exposed to mechanical pressure",

This important node characteristic usually results in difficulties in employing most of the common wireless network protocols in WSNs unfavorably. The effective usage of limited sensor node energy & other sources is of importance in WSN security researches. Moreover, research on especially increasing network security of the WSNs employed in health applications recently receives a remarkable attention. In this paper, a new highly secure WSN data link layer security protocol named hereafter as YP is proposed and itsfundamental performance evaluation is presented. It combines the CTR and CBC–MAC approaches with the SEA block encryption algorithm for increased data confidentiality and authentication & integrity functions, respectively. The security level of the YP can be dynamically boosted up employing these methods together. In addition, using the proposed YP with the 96-bit data block/key size has a trivial effect on the WSN node energy consumption that is ignorably increased compared to that of the traditional TinySEC protocol while employing the YP with the 192-bit data block/key size providing an extremely high level of security",

One of these factors is the welding groove design. This isbecause different stresses (tensile, compression, bending, etc.) can occur onthe weldments. For this reason, while designing welded constructions, it is importantto join them with the most appropriate welding groove configuration byconsidering the stresses the welded joints can be exposed to. In this study,the effect of the welding groove configuration on the mechanical andmetallurgical properties of S275 structural steel joined by flux cored arcwelding (FCAW) method was investigated. For this purpose, different weldinggroove configurations were formed for structural steel sheets. Tensile,bending, and hardness tests were performed to determine the mechanicalproperties of the weldments. In addition, metallographic investigations werecarried out to determine the metallurgical properties of the weld zones. As aresult of the tests, the effect of the welding groove configuration on themechanical and metallurgical properties of the welded joints was determined. Asa result of the microstructure studies, different structures such as grainboundary ferrite, widmanstatten ferrite and acicular ferrite were determined toform in the weld metal and coarse grained zone. It was determined that hardnessof the weld metal was higher than HAZ and base metal in all welding grooveconfigurations. As a result of the tensile and bending tests, the highesttensile and bending strengths were obtained from the samples welded by X2type welding groove configuration after the base metal. Furthermore, the X-typewelding groove configurations showed better mechanical properties than theK-type welding groove configurations.",

These methods are effective however they, require a longconstruction period, may cause loss of architectural functionality anddeteriorate structural aesthetics. Therefore the development of a new techniqueis quite useful. In this study, masonry walls are strengthened with steelstrips or steel plates which is cheap to provide and easy to obtain. Presentedexperimental study covers the results of 4 walls built with hollow clay masonryunit (BT), of which 3 of them were strengthened symmetrically using threedifferent (A, B and C) steel member schemes.

Achieving the desired results in the analyses to be made depends on measuring the amount of radioactive substance to be given to patients with the least possible error.

This can be possible with the condition that radioisotope calibrators that enable measuring the radioactive substance must have proper performances. In order to achieve this target, measurement for linearity tests were performed with two different radioisotope calibrators, ; Capintec 15 R [(Seri no:159083)-number one calibrator] and Biodex ATOM LAB-500 [(Seri no:9100052)-number two calibrator] in a Nuclear Medicine Center. By using a short half-life radioisotope (Tc-99m ) in these measurements, linearity tests of devices have been performed by using the method of decreasing source, increasing source and sample-volume effect. In consequence of these tests, tests, which is done for both calibrators are within the error limits (%5), but according to the test results of the performance of number one calibrator, it is better than with a very small difference.",

        "abstract": "This study examines the thermal residual stressanalysis of one-dimensional functionally graded clamped hollow circular plates(FGCP) that are functionally graded on the adhesive layer under in-plane heatflux for different compositional gradient exponents. The material properties ofthe hollow circular plates were assumed in-plane according to a power-lawdistribution. The volume fraction of the constituent varies in the plane, notin the plate thickness direction. The transient heat condition and Navier’sequations in polar coordinates describing the one-dimensional thermo-elasticmodel were discretized using finite-difference method, and the set of linearequations were solved using the pseudo singular-value method. The elasticitymodulus in adhesive layers varied from 2000 MPa to 6500 MPa and from 6500 MPato 2000 MPa, and the grading of this layer was performed for three differentcompositional grading exponents. The adhesive region and both circular platesare grading along the plane in the radial direction and the compositionalgradient exponent of both circular plates is taken as m = 1.0 and this value isheld constant for the determination of the results of the grading in theadhesive layer.This study has shown that equivalent stressdistributions are significantly influenced by adhesively bonded plates. It hasbeen emphasized that depending on the thermal boundary condition, when theadhesive layer is graded from a low modulus of elasticity to a high modulus ofelasticity (2000 → 6500 MPa), the equivalent stress level of the adhesive layeris reduced by 25% compared to the other case. It has been stated that the fieldof influence of the equivalent stress in the maximum levels shrinks byincreasing the increase of the compositional gradient exponent n = 0.1 to n =1.0.According to the results of the study, thecompositional grading upper limit of the adhesive layer with optimum propertiesand performance in functional graded circular plate joints was set to n = 1.0.It also emphasizes the necessity of grading the adhesive layer so that thethermal stress in the adhesive layer and the interface of the connection can bereduced to a minimum.",

        "abstract": "Alumina (Al2O3), which is a veryimportant material due to its superior physical and technological properties,is widely used in industry and almost all of alumina is obtained from Bayerprocess using bauxite as a raw material. However, some technical and economicalhandicaps of alumina production with Bayer process (such as limited or nonavailability of bauxite reserves in some countries, reduction of high gradebauxite deposits, growing alumina demand for industry etc.) require alternativeraw material sources and methods to produce alumina. Therefore, investigationson the alumina production from non-bauxite sources is one of the currentstudies in related literature as well. Clay minerals are considered to be thebest available source of non-bauxite raw material for alumina production.Because clay minerals are abundant and common in the earth crust, they haverelatively high grade of aluminum, when compared to other sources, clay miningis easier and require simpler preparation and enrichment processes. There arevarious processes developed to produce alumina from clays, but among them\"Acid Leaching Process\" has become well-known method that could bepracticed as a more effective method in alumina production due to someadvantages.  Moreover, it is seen thatthere is a consensus on Acid Leaching Process. Besides, there are currentstudies investigating  several technicalmodifications and improvements on the process steps.The aim of this studyprepared by reviewing the studies obtained from literature and current experimentalresults on production of alümina from clays is to give information particularlyto alumina industry and stakeholders and related researchers, and to contributeto scientific studies on this topic.",

Two dimensional transientnumerical analyzes have been carried out with the ANSYS Fluent commercialprogram using the computational fluid dynamics (HAD) approach. The study hasbeen first validated for the without fin model with reference to anexperimental study available in the literature. In this model, the effect oftemperature of heat transfer fluid (HTF)on PCM melting time has evaluated by taking HTF’s temperatures 50oC,60oC and 70oC. Then, 6, 9, 12 and 15 fins have beenadded to this model and the effect of the number of fins on the PCM meltingtime has been investigated. The results obtained in the numerical study showthat as the HTF temperature and number of fins increase, the melting time ofPCM decreases, so that PCM stores more rapidly the heat from HTF. It has beendetermined that the fin models with 6, 9, 12 and 15 which are 2,66, 3,49, 4,32and 5,15 of fin effectiveness reduce the melting time by 72,5%, 76,7%, 78,4%and 80% respectively, according to without fin model.",

        "abstract": "The present study deals with combustion characteristics of methane and coke oven gas for various swirl numbers in a highly internal recirculative combustor under colorless distributed combustion conditions. In order to achieve that, the fuels have been consumed numerically in the combustor at various oxygen concentrations by using a N2 diluent to reduce oxygen concentration in the air. During the modelings, swirl number has been changed from s=0 to s=1 in an interval of 0.2. In this way, swirler effects on its combustion characteristics have been studied. In order to perform all modelings, the k-ε realizable turbulence model, the PDF/Mixture Fraction combustion model, and P-1 radiation model have been used. The results showed that decrease in oxygen concentration caused a more uniform temperature field in the combustor along with ultra-low NOx emissions. When the oxygen rate was reduced from 21% to 15%, a 9% decrease in the highest temperature reached in the combustion chamber was observed. In addition, a 99% decrease in nitrogen oxide formation was observed. This has been achieved with internal and external (colorless distributed regime) entrainments. In addition to these, it is concluded that the swirler has affected that combustion took place faster mostly because of better air-fuel mixture in the combustor. It has been observed that the air and fuel mixture occurs faster in the swirler effect, which has effects on the flow characteristics in the combustion chamber and has positive effects on recirculation, which can help to obtain conditions close to distributed combustion conditions in general. For 21% oxygen ratio, nitrogen oxide formation could be reduced by approximately 50% by increasing the swirl number from 0 to 1.",

In this study, the diagnosis of colon cancer is performed using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and metaheuristic methods. Various CNN architectures, including GoogLeNet and ResNet-50, were employed to extract features related to colon disease. However, inaccuracies were introduced in both feature extraction and data classification due to the abundance of features. To address this issue, feature reduction techniques were implemented using combined Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Superior convergence speed in optimizing the fitness function was observed in the case of ACO-PSO. With ResNet-50 producing 2048 features and GoogLeNet generating 1024 features, the reduction of feature dimensions proved to be crucial in identifying the most informative elements. Encouraging results were obtained in the evaluation of metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1 score, which were found to be 99.50%, 99.93%, 99.97%, and 99.97%, respectively.",

With the semantic similarity detection of patents, it will be possible to automatically determine the patentability criteria, which is the most difficult and time-consuming phase of the patent application process. Set theory approaches, vector space model approaches or ontology etc. are used to determine how similar patent texts are to each other by structuralizing them with text mining methods. There are approaches that make use of information sources. However, due to the complex structure and unique terminology of patent texts, the targeted efficiency cannot be obtained from these methods. In order to overcome this deficiency, deep learning methods, which have shown great success in every field they are used, should also be utilized in the semantic comparison of patent texts. Although studies have been carried out in this area, models that can effectively detect patentability are still in their infancy. After a qualified model is developed and patentability is determined, the automatic preparation of the patent search report will be an important step in meeting the great need in the field of technology management.",

User historical data can be used to extract interests and enhance CTR prediction, leading to higher accuracy. In this study, a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has been used to tackle the issue of insufficient dataset for click-through rates. Furthermore, six different machine learning algorithms have been assessed in predicting ad click behavior. For the experimental study, we obtained user demographic and online activity data from Kaggle, along with a binary label indi-cating ad clicks. To enhance the model's performance, we employed a GAN for data augmenta-tion and generated additional training examples. We compared the machine-learning algorithm's outcomes with and without GAN-based data augmentation to evaluate its predicted accuracy. According to the findings, most algorithms have increased sensitivity and specificity after utilis-ing GAN to augment the data, indicating that the generated data has improved their ability to accurately distinguish positive and negative events. GAN-based data augmentation boosted all models to varying degrees, according to the findings.",

The fact that the natural frequency of the wing is small causes the wing to displace more, while at the same time, it can cause resonance when the natural frequency of the wing and the natural frequency of the air are equal. Studies carried out to increase the natural frequency of the wing can increase the rigidity of the wing while increasing its mass. This study identified a multiobjective optimization problem for increasing the natural frequency of wings without increasing the wing mass. For this objective, optimization of the wing spar element was carried out. The wing cross-sectional geometry parameters are taken as design variables. Minimizing the weight of the wing and maximizing the first natural frequency of the wing are defined as objective functions. A multiobjective optimization study was carried out to increase the natural frequency of the wing and reduce its mass. This research aims to design a wing spar section with optimum properties in terms of natural frequency and weight of the cross-sectional geometry of the spar element from the wing internal structure elements. To perform the optimization process, modeling the parametric geometry, calculation of the pressure distribution on the wing, stress and displacement by static analysis, and calculation of the natural frequency by the modal analysis model was constructed via the Ansys Workbench environment. A multiobjective genetic algorithm was used in the optimization study using the response surface method. As a result of the study, the wing’s first natural frequency increased by 14%, and the wing mass decreased by about 5%.",

Ransomware is malicious software that demands ransom from innocent users by blocking access to information systems. Since traditional methods are limited to predefined blacklists, they may be ineffective against unknown ransomware types. Deep learning methods, on the other hand, offer a sensitive defense mechanism against anomalies by learning normal behavior patterns. In this study, the Internet logs of Android devices consisting of 392,034 rows and 86 columns were studied using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The dataset contains 14 different Android ransomware families and harmless traffic. Data preprocessing steps include missing data management, outlier analysis, feature selection, coding operations, and data normalization/standardization. The dataset was split at 80% training - 20% test ratio, and it was determined that the 80% training - 20% test split had the highest accuracy.

        "abstract": "Normally, cutting tool tools are directly used by assembling on the CNC turning machines. The position of the tool is not controlled relative to the centre of the work piece. It is assumed that the cutting tools are manufactured in standard sizes. However, the cutting tools composed of many parts, such as insert, shim and holder, etc. Many companies can manufacture these parts in universal tolerances. In this study, turning tests were carried out to investigate the effects of the height of the insert from the machined workpiece axis. AISI 304 stainless steel material was turned on a CNC lathe using a carbide cutting tool with a negative backward rake angle. The cutting tool were tested for three levels, such as, at the workpiece axis (0.0 mm), above of the workpiece axis (+0.5 mm) and below of the work piece axis (-0.5 mm). In the experiments, three different cutting speeds (100, 150, and 225 m/min), three different feed rates (0.15, 0.25 and 0.35 mm/rev), three different depths of cut (0.8, 1.3 and 2 mm) and two different insert radius (0.4 and 0.8 mm) were preferred for the cutting parameters. L36 model, which is an option in Taguchi method, were selected to perform the tests. Surface roughness, circularity and cylindricity on the machined surfaceses were controlled. The results were evaluated by Taguchi and ANOVA analyses. The results figured out that the height of the cutting tool affected the geometries of the machined surface. The rate of the effects is 1.37% on the surface roughness, 10.89% on the circularity deviation and 4.49% on the cylindricity deviation. The H:+0.5 lead to have a positive impact on surface roughness and the cylindricity deviation.",

        "abstract": "In electronic warfare systems, accurate estimation of the threat radar frequency is so important for radar identification and electronic attack. Digital instantaneous frequency estimation (DIFM) and fast Fourier transform (FFT) are the most widely used frequency estimation methods. If the intermediate frequency (IF) value of the threat radar is not an exact multiple of the FFT bins, frequency estimation with the FFT method cannot be obtained with the desired accuracy. Interpolation techniques are often applied to the output of the FFT to improve accuracy. In the DIFM method, the digitized IF signal is delayed for a certain time and its conjugate is taken and  phase is calculated by multiplying the conjugate with the original I/Q signal. In this study, the frequency estimation performances of the  FFT technique that Jacobsen and Improved Quinn interpolation techniques were applied and DIFM method with appropriate delay time extensively analyzed by changing the signal to noise ratio (SNR) under Gauss noise. Also, since fast frequency estimation is so important for real time systems, FFT, FFT and Jacobsen, FFT and improved Quinn and DIFM frequency estimation methods were also compared in terms of computation time. For each method, one hundred Monte Carlo trials were applied and the error in the frequency estimation is presented in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE). According to the simulation results performed in the MATLAB environment, it has been observed that the FFT and the improved Quinn method generally provide better frequency estimation than the FFT and Jacobsen method. In addition, as the SNR level increased, it was observed that the DIFM method had better performance (lower RMSE value) than the FFT, FFT and improved Quinn and FFT and Jacobsen methods.",

Samples prepared using different welding currents were investigated for their tensile-shear strengths, fracture energies, fracture modes, and geometric properties of the joints. It has been determined that when double-pulse resistance spot welding is used, expulsion occurs later during the joining process, allowing for larger nugget diameters to be achieved as a result. As a result, in double-pulse welding applications, the tensile-shear strength and fracture energy have been improved by 4.5% and 14.6%, respectively, compared to single-pulse welding. Additionally, in double-pulse welding applications, mechanical strengths have become more stable, and the standard deviations in measurements have decreased significantly.",

However, it is impossible to determine the properties of rocks such as UCS directly due to the lack of standardized sample preparation, necessary equipment, etc. In this case, the UCS of rocks is estimated by index test methods such as hardness, ultrasound velocity, etc. Determining the hardness of rocks is relatively more practical, fast, and inexpensive than other properties. In this study, the UCS of sedimentary rocks was estimated as a function of Leeb hardness using artificial neural networks (ANN) and SVM regression analysis. With the proposed neural network and SVM regression models, it is aimed to obtain more accurate and faster prediction values. To better train the models created in the study, the number of data was increased by compiling data from the studies in the literature.

It was proved that the models created with ANN and SVM regression can be used reliably in predicting UCS values.",

For multicell crashworthiness, which is considered a dual gradient, the folding style was insufficient in lobe formation. However, the specific energy absorption (SEA) and the crushing force efficiency (CFE)  values of the two types of dual gradient structures behaved appropriately in absorbing kinetic energy. The dual gradient new design of crashworthiness provides resistance by preventing the bending of the structure under oblique loading. According to the results of the analysis, the mean SEA and CFE under loading at all angles for the 2nd order dual gradient configuration was 12.88% and 1.61% higher than the 1st order design.

The characterization of electrospun mats showed that electrospinnability of prepared solution was possible with wet electrospinning at identical process, solution and environmental conditions. It was noticed that the average fiber diameter was 979.18 nm, thicker nanofibrous mats were fabricated and a few bead formation was observed in wet electrospun mats. But bead-dominant structure was obtained in dry electrospun mats despite of finer average fiber diameter (271.22 nm). Similar crystalline structure and no distinct bond occurence was observed in wet and dry electrospun nanocomposite mats. The average mat thickness of wet electrospun mats was approximately 65 times higher than dry electrospun mat. In wet electrospinning, use of liquid in collector promoted surface unevenness, decreased beading formation, facilitated fiber-to-fiber interaction and influenced pore distribution positively due to high surface tension of distilled water.",

        "abstract": "Masonry structures are buildings whose load-bearing system consists of vertical walls made of different units such as bricks, aerated concrete or natural stones. Masonry structures are quite common because they can be built quickly and economically with the use of local materials without requiring skilled labor. In the design of masonry structures and in the analyses of existing masonry structures, it is very important to determine the mechanical properties of the material accurately and to use them in the calculation models created with the micro model technique. In this study, the mechanical behaviour of hollow brick, clay brick and aerated concrete masonry units under uniaxial compressive loading was investigated experimentally for the purpose of masonry analysis. Using the experimental results, the concrete damage plasticity (CDP) model is proposed for the clay-based brick material for applications to be analysed by micro modelling technique in finite element software. The method used in the study will provide light for experimental studies to be carried out to determine the mechanical properties of different types of masonry units and to reflect them to the analysis models.",

        "abstract": "The global steel industry, holding paramount economic significance, is characterized by the inherent volatility of steel prices. Leveraging the reliable weekly steel plate price data from the Commodity Research Unit (CRU), this research employs sophisticated machine learning algorithms to forecast plate prices. The dataset spans from July 27, 2011, to July 5, 2023, encompassing six key predictive factors. Notably, total inventory levels exhibit the highest correlation (0.88) with plate prices, with the finished goods inventory value of heavy machinery emerging as the most influential factor. A comprehensive training regimen is undertaken for machine learning models, incorporating Prophet, XGBoost, LSTM, and GRU. Time Series Cross-Validation is implemented to maintain the temporal order of the data, and a Bayesian optimization function is employed for hyperparameter tuning. XGBoost emerges as the top-performing model, yielding the lowest Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 332.25 and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 14.55. Demonstrating superior predictive accuracy, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.94% and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) score of 18.06, XGBoost establishes itself as the most effective model in steel plate price forecasting. This outcome underscores the efficacy of advanced machine learning methodologies in navigating the complexities of steel market dynamics for enhanced predictive insights.",

After extruding this alloy at 375°C, multidirectional forging was performed at 400°C. The effect of alloy components on the microstructural change and their impact on mechanical properties were investigated. It was determined that the Rare Earth Elements added to the AZ31 cast alloy with a coarse-grained structure and the mechanical processes applied were effective in the microstructure. The addition of Gd and Y to the alloy promoted the formation of intermetallic phases such as (Mg,Al)3Gd and Mg24Y5 in the microstructure, leading to a significant reduction in grain size. It was found that the samples obtained by adding 0.5% Gd and Y Rare Earth Elements to the alloy had higher hardness, yield strength, and tensile strength values compared to the cast and 1% Gd and Y addition values. On the other hand, it was determined that the mechanical processes applied to the cast AZ31 alloy reduced the grain size and improved the mechanical properties.Keywords: AZ31, Gadolinium, Yttrium, Multi Directional Forging, Extrusion",

GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) have started to be widely used in the medical field due to their ability to generate realistic images. Recent research has concentrated on three different deep generative models for improving medical images, and a review of deep learning architectures for data augmentation has been done. In this article, other generative models are emphasized, given the dominance of GANs in the field. Studies have conducted a literature review comparing different deep generative models for medical image data augmentation, without focusing solely on GANs or traditional data augmentation methods. In contrast to variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks (GANs) are the generative model that is most frequently employed for enhancing medical image data. Recent studies have shown that diffusion models have received more attention in recent years compared to variational autoencoders and GANs for medical image data augmentation. This trend is thought to be related to the fact that many GAN-related research directions have previously been investigated, making it more challenging to advance these architectures' current applications.",

It is important to develop these systems to reduce the current costs of wastewater treatment systems and to evaluate urban wastewater, having a great energy potential in terms of biodegradable organic substances, while reducing its polluting effects on the environment. The structure of the material used as anode electrode in MFC cells directly affects the adhesion of microorganisms to the anode, oxidation of the substrate and electron transfer. In order to be used in MFC, nickel foam (NF) with a three-dimensional and macroporous structure was coated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to ensure a good electrical connection by attachment of microorganisms to the surface and the most suitable molybdenum (Mo) loading method was determined to increase the adhesion of electron-producing bacterial species to the surface. Also, the effects of heat treatment with H2 gas before loading and using ethylene glycol (EG) as reducing agent in the hydrothermal deposition were investigated in Mo loadings. As a result of the study, it was observed that adding EG to the starting solution increased Mo loading, while passing H2 gas disrupted the surface morphology. When the SEM images and EDS analyzes were examined after the study, it was observed that the most homogeneous surface morphology and the highest efficiency were in the NK/rGO/Mo-E sample, which contained 84.39% Mo by mass.",

This research paper presents a comparatmive analysis of the energy and exergy performance of pyrolysis and gasification systems. The study investigates two critical process conditions: low-temperature pyrolysis at 500°C and high-temperature gasification at 900°C. The analysis integrates thermodynamic equilibrium calculations and modeling to produce hydrogen and offers a comprehensive evaluation of energy and exergy efficiencies. The comparison is carried out between a downdraft gasifier and a pyrolysis process, both employing wood chips as the biomass feedstock. This paper delves into the energy and exergy yields of these distinct thermal conversion methods for energy production. The research identifies pyrolysis at 900°C as the optimal model condition due to its lower energy consumption and the absence of agent materials. Energy and exergy analyses are conducted at both 500°C and 900°C for all processes. The model results demonstrate that pyrolysis yields 60% energy at 500°C and 94% at 900°C.

The formation of cracks in the structures allows the aggressive chemical components to easily penetrate and pass into the cement-based material, thus reducing the durability of the material. Many attempts have been made to overcome the negative aspects of the brittle behavior of cementitious materials under load. Engineered Cementitious Composites (ECC) with highly increased ductility is one such initiative. ECC is a high-performance PVA fiber-reinforced cementitious composite with high ductility and high damage tolerance characteristics under mechanical loading. In the current experimental study, it was aimed to investigate the change in flexural toughness of engineered cementitious composites (ECC) containing high volume of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS). Thus, the effect of both utilization rate of GGBFS and aggregate on the flexural toughness of the designed mixtures was evaluated for the curing age of 28 day. Accordingly, a total of eight different mixtures with GGBFS to binder ratios of 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 and aggregate to binder ratios of 0.36 and 0.45 were produced. The water to binder ratio was kept constant as 0.3 and the maximum particle size of aggregate was 600 µm. Test results showed that a decrease and an increase in flexural toughness were obtained with the increase in both GYFC substitution ratio and aggregate-binder ratio, respectively.",

On the other hand, the Forming Limit Diagram (FLD) is widely preferred to evaluate the deformation ability of sheet metals. Another important method used to measure the stretch forming ability of sheet materials is the Erichsen cupping test. In this test, the sheet metal clamped between the die and the blank holder is formed with a spherical punch, and the distance taken by the punch until crack formation begins on the sheet surface is defined as the Erichsen Index (EI). In this study, researches related to the effects of the factors arising from material properties and experimental conditions on FLD and EI values were compiled and evaluated. In general, it has been detected that the formability of sheet materials increases with the increase of the strain hardening exponent (n) and the temperature. In the literature, it was found out that the EI value got larger with the increase in sheet thickness and punch diameter, as well as with lubrication.",

Methods to reduce the amount of cement used in concrete production, for example, are being investigated to determine how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in many applications. Egg shells and various industrial wastes, which are recommended to use in the construction sector at an appropriately high rate, also cause serious environmental damage. Bottom ash (BA) and marble powder (MP) wastes are used today in civil engineering applications. In addition, it is important to increase the use of eggshells due to their rich calcium carbonate content. In this work, BA and MP wastes were blended with eggshells to produce cement paste composites. Two different sets of composites were prepared during this study. The composites were prepared with cement (80%), BA (20%), and MP (20%) wastes by weight with 0.3%, 0.75%, 1.5%, and 2.5% eggshell waste.  The fresh (flow table), physical (dry unit mass, apparent specific gravity, and porosity), mechanical (unconfined compressive strength and flexural strength), and durability (water absorption, seawater resistance) tests were conducted. According to the experimental results, the composites can be classified as lightweight construction materials. The test results showed that 0.75% eggshell by weight of cement in bottom ash and marble powder can be used as an optimum value for better performance. The bottom ash mixtures groups are higher water absorption and porosity values when referring to the marble powder mixture groups. The highest compressive strength value was found at 56.03 MPa in the MP mixture group and 52.79 MPa in the BA mixture groups with these optimum eggshell combinations at 56 days. The MP mixture group showed better resistance to seawater when referring to the bottom ash blended mixtures. Laboratory-produced composites are possible candidates for cost-effective and environmentally friendly building materials. The eggshells have a promising alternative binder for concrete in the near future and they are utilized together with industrial wastes such as BA and MP in sustainable concrete construction.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the effects of natural environmental degradation have been significantly felt on the world's oceans. Studies show that both human-made pollutants like plastics and marine organisms such as invasive species are now densely present in our seas. On the other hand, the cooling water systems, a critical component of ships, rely on seawater absorbed through the ship's sea chests. However, clogging sea chests due to marine pollution can render the ship's main and auxiliary engines inoperable, depriving the ship of its maneuverability. A ship that loses its main engine power and therefore its maneuverability is at risk of facing accidents such as collisions, groundings, fires, and explosions. This study conducted a risk analysis on the blockage of sea chests, a hidden threat of marine pollution. Using both Classical and Fuzzy Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) methodologies, risks were quantitatively calculated through Risk Priority Numbers (RPN) and Fuzzy RPN (FRPN) scores. According to the Traditional FMEA findings, the top three highest-risk failure modes are HT006 - Main Engine High Lubricating Oil Temperature (143.520), HT007 - Main Engine High Jacket Water Temperature (111.720), and HT014 - Fire Pump Low Outlet Pressure and Flow Rate (100.590). The Fuzzy FMEA results indicated the top three highest-risk failure modes as HT006 - Main Engine High Lubricating Oil Temperature (5.58), HT014 - Fire Pump Low Outlet Pressure and Flow Rate (5.51), and HT013 - Insufficient Boiler Steam Condensate Efficiency (5.47). The obtained findings quantitatively demonstrate the impact of marine pollution on ship systems. Analysis results provides critical information for key maritime stakeholders such as seafarers, maritime companies, regulatory authorities, and the shipbuilding industry to prevent major maritime accidents caused by sea chest blockages in the future.",

Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) systems have been developed and widely used to meet the increasing bus need. Optical amplifier systems play an important role in the transmission of optical signals over long distances in the use of WDM systems. For this reason, multi-pump distributed fiber Raman amplifiers are a good alternative. When designing distributed Raman amplifier systems, the power of the pump must be optimized along with a certain number of optical signals to be included in the optical fiber to flatten the gain of the signals in the transmission of optical signals over long distances. In this context, it was aimed to flatten the gain of 80 optical signals with an initial power value of 1mW as a result of 80 km transmission. For this, Raman gain coefficient and optical attenuation coefficient were first processed into the system as polynomials and made ready. Then, the constant terms were entered into the equation, and then all the equations were successfully adapted to the PSO algorithm. Afterwards, the PSO algorithm was operated for 4,5 and 6 pumps and optimum values were obtained. When the net gain differences are examined: ± 3dB for 4 pumps, ± 2dB for 5 pumps and ± 1dB for 6 pumps are obtained. It is expected that better results will be obtained in parallel with the increase in the solution power of the optimization algorithms.",

Especially in the last 10 years, with the proliferation of desktop type 3D printers in the additive manufacturing sector, thermoplastics have become the most widely used plastic material. Therewith, the assembly of materials produced by this method has gained so much importance. Since plastic materials have low surface energy, there are difficulties in performing the adhesive bonding process, which is a popular joining method, and some issues (adhesive type, surface cleaning, etc.) should be carefully considered. In this study; PLA sheets were produced by means of additive manufacturing method and joined with two different adhesives (Loctite 9492 and Terason 9225). For surface preparation, mechanical sanding was performed using 320 and 600 grit size SiC sandpaper. Adhesive bonding joints were created from PLA-PLA material with three different adhesive thicknesses (0.3, 0.18 and 0.1mm). Joints were subjected to tensile test and their mechanical properties were examined. The results showed that high fill ratio in 3D printing increases the strength of parts. In addition, the strength of the adhesively bonded surfaces is affected by the variation of the adhesive thickness and the adhesive type. Whilst an increase in the adhesive thickness increases the strength of Loctite EA 9492 joints; just an opposite effect in Teroson PU 9225 joints was observed.",

Particularly in the automotive industry, robots that are utilized for heavy tasks such as welding, palletizing, assembly, and transportation offer significant advantages in terms of high-potential work, but also expose numerous occupational safety risks. Additionally, with the increasing utilization of collaborative robots, safety has become one of the most crucial concerns. Several standards have been established for robotic lines within the framework of occupational safety and are currently widely used. These standards allow manufacturers to produce consistent quality and performance products while trying to ensure that the residual risks remain at an acceptable level. Unfortunately, during the implementation of these studies, the human factor is often overlooked and excluded from the scope of risk calculations. In this study, to address this gap, risk analysis and risk reduction studies were implemented on a robot line used for welding processes in the automotive industry. Functional safety calculations were evaluated based on system design parameters while taking into account robotic safety standards. At this stage, the human factor was also included in the analysis. In this context, a fuzzy set-based fault tree analysis method has been developed to model the relevant uncertainties. This approach allows not only the evaluation of the categories and reliability parameters of the relevant equipment, but also the investigation of the impact of human-robot interaction on system reliability. Finally, the adequacy of the results obtained has been examined within the framework of sector-specific standards",

A Self Tuning PID controller based on Fuzzy Logic was developed for axis controls in the stabilization algorithm. Thanks to this controller, which works with the principle of choosing the most appropriate coefficient at every step, it was possible to control with less than 3% errors in the tests performed with the flight simulator. In addition, a PID controller whose coefficients are optimized with Particle Swarm Optimization is designed for comparison purposes. In experimental studies, it was seen that PID with adjustable coefficients gave better results than the fixed PID.",

In order to carry out an effective investigation by determining the variables related to the crime and those involved in the event, it is necessary to analyze the samples quickly, in small quantities, and even in the form of mixtures. Therefore, it is of high importance to analyze evidential materials with non-destructive, fast, cost-effective techniques. Spectroscopic methods have advanced significantly in recent years with important developments in light detectors and take place among forensic procedures. This study focused on Raman and Surface Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) for detecting pure urine mixed stains. In order to reduce the fluorescence effect caused by the matrix components of the urine, dilution was made and Raman analyses were performed for four different concentrations. It was observed that as the concentration decreased, the noise ratio decreased and the peaks became more pronounced. A simulated crime scene containing stains of pure urine, diluted urine (1:2, 1:4, and 1:8), apple juice, mixture (apple juice and different concentrations of urine), and gold nanorod/silver nanoparticle doped mixtures were created to check the detectability of urine from a complex crime scene. Despite the low peak intensity in the Raman spectrum, the presence of urine was still detectable. The SERS spectrums of the stains obtained from the simulated crime scene were examined first with the addition of gold nanorods and subsequently with the addition of silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles, known for their strong plasmonic properties, were found to provide greater signal enhancement compared to gold nanorods.",

Second, Gaussian filtering, Discrete Wavelet Transform, and k-means clustering algorithms were tested. The Canny operator separates follicles from the background in the segmentation phase. In this study, a CNN architecture that classifies limited ultrasound ovary images was developed, and its success in the best follicle detection method was presented. The highest follicle detection accuracy of 97.63% was achieved with adaptive thresholding using a Wiener filter. Besides, the ultrasound images of the ovaries were classified as \"normal\" or \"polycystic ovary syndrome\" using CNN architecture with classification accuracy of 65.81% for unsegmented ovarian images and 77.81% for segmented images. In addition to the proposed method, classification was performed using SqueezeNet-based transfer learning, which was successful in limited datasets, and 74.18% classification accuracy  was achieved for the unsegmented images and 75.54 % for segmented images .

This study aims to analyze prefabricated facade panels with wooden structures in terms of operational and embodied energy, providing guidance to designers in selecting suitable concepts. Calculations were conducted on a selected sample building. Compared to the traditional Baghdadi wall, the sandwich panel scenario with PUR insulation material resulted in energy savings of 53.21 percent. The massive CLT panel, which lacks insulation material or cladding, showed the lowest energy gain at 15.91 percent. Considering the overall emissions in the analysis, it has been determined that embodied carbon emissions have a greater impact than operational carbon emissions. Therefore, it is essential to emphasize the significant role of material selection for prefabricated facade panels in reducing carbon emissions.",

Therefore, it is very important to investigate the historical drought patterns at the regional level for drought mitigation and prevention strategies at national and international scales. Fort his reasın in the presented study, a meteorological drought analysis of the Çoruh Basin in the northeast of Turkey was conducted. In determining meteorological drought, 52 years of precipitation data measured between 1969 and 2020 at five different meteorological observation stations located within the borders of the basin were used. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) method, which calculates only based on precipitation parameter, was used in the drought analysis. The occurrence percentages of dry and rainy periods in 1-, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month periods were obtained, and the percentages of occurrence of different drought classes were evaluated. In addition, the duration of the driest period and the severity and magnitude of the drought were obtained at all stations. The results obtained determined that the longest dry period (critical period) in the basin was mostly experienced after 2010. With the increase in the time scale, the duration and severity of drought increased at stations other than the İspir station. It has been determined that the Tortum station is the riskiest in terms of drought among the stations studied.",

The LPG tanks were subjected to burst and fatigue tests to explore their burst pressures and fatigue performances using both experimental and computer aided techniques. To investigate the strength of the tanks, a universal test bench was developed and calibrated for use in both burst and fatigue tests. The obtained experimental results in terms of burst and fatigue failure locations for each brand of tank are compared with the results obtained using finite element based simulations. Visual solid models in 3D were drawn in SolidWorks and then ANSYS software was used to perform Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations on those LPG cylinders to obtain the results, such as stresses, deformations, burst and fatigue failure locations. As a result of this comparison, it has been observed that some brands of cylindrical LPG tanks are more durable and safe for use in vehicles. Since the same standard requirements and the same commercial material are used in LPG tank production, it is revealed that some companies need to reconsider their design, manufacturing and especially welding processes. The results of this independent and objective study can also be used as a warning for LPG tank manufacturers and as a guide for their customers in choosing a safe product.",

The synthesis method is based on high vacuum post-sulphidation of Cu thin films deposited by rf. magnetron sputtering. Sputtering conditions have been optimized so as to reduce grain size for better diffusion of S atoms through grain boundaries. XRD pattern of the precursor Cu sample revealed fcc structure with an average crystallite size of 24 nm. Best sulphidation was obtained at 175 oC for 60 min. The crystallite size of CuS calculated from the dominant peak of (110) planes was approximately 48 nm while average grain size observed via SEM was about 400 nm. Raman spectroscopy confirmed CuS structure by scattering peaks at around 467-472 cm-1. Elemental mapping unveiled homogenous distribution of Cu and S atoms over the surface. According to EDS data, at% compositions of Cu and S were 51.6% and 48.4%, respectively. Moreover, SIMS investigation has demonstrated uniformity of S atoms through the thickness of CuS thin film. Although XRD, Raman, and EDS analysis have resulted in predominant formation of CuS structure, existence of Cu2S phase with a strong luminescence peak located at 1.8 eV was determined by PL spectroscopy.",

Game technology is also used in children who are faced with Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). In this study, two-dimensional games performed on the basis of PASS (Planning, Attention, Simultaneity and Sequence) theory were applied to 15 individuals aged 10-18 with ADHD diagnosed, 3 days a week for 15 minutes for 12 weeks. The pre-test at the end of the 1st week and the post-test at the end of the 12th week were applied to the participants with the test battery developed. The pretest and posttest were used to determine the effectiveness of attention, coordination, cognitive flexibility, planning, spatial perception, working memory, processing speed and short-term memory games. In addition, to compare the scores obtained, the Moxo d-CPT test was applied to the participants before and after the application and their scores were recorded. As a result of the study, an increase of 3.5% was observed in the first test and post-test mean values of attention and processing speed, while an increase of approximately 10% was achieved in the average values of planning, working memory and short-term memory. An increase of 30% was observed in the mean value of spatial perception between the first test and the last test. According to the findings, when the pre-test and post-test averages of children with ADHD were compared, it was observed that there was an increase in attention, planning, spatial perception, working memory, processing speed and short-term memory, while there was a 1% decrease in coordination and cognitive flexibility. When the attention, impulsivity, timing and hyperactivity scores of the Moxo d-CPT test were compared with the pre-test and post-test scores, it was seen that the developed system was effective on the participants. Whether this positive effect is due to digital games based on Pass theory or because participants felt that they were valuable and important during the test is the next research topic.",

The necessity of execution of a large number of work items for the construction of a building and the large number of building material options make it difficult to conduct embodied energy and carbon emission analyzes of building constructions. In this study, a framework system is developed to overcome the mentioned difficulties. Construction items of a typical single-story building that can be built in the rural region are arranged and different construction options are generated for the construction items. The amounts of material and construction equipment requirements for the unit construction item of all construction options are computed. Semantic relationships between the building elements and the construction alternatives are established so that the quantity values that may vary according to the selected work item can be calculated exactly. Cost, embodied energy and carbon emissions caused by the construction of the building are calculated by matching the quantity values with the unit construction item definitions. Moreover, the heat loss calculations of the building are carried out according to TS 825 and the energy consumption, carbon emission and cost that will occur as a result of the utilization of wood, coal, electric stove and air conditioner options as heating source during its 50 years of life cycle are calculated. In order to examine the effects of construction items on the embodied energy, carbon emission and cost, Monte Carlo simulation is implemented by forming the building with random selections for each construction item among the defined construction options with equal probability of selection. At the end of the simulation the total embodied energy, carbon emission and cost of both the construction and the utilization phases of the structure are calculated. In this manner, the average embodied energy, carbon emission and cost effect of each of the construction items on the structure are determined. Prepared embodied energy and carbon emission quantities of the construction items and the analysis results presented within this study have the potential to be beneficial to the researchers studying on green buildings.",

In this study, tubular daylight guidance systems (TDGS) and movable shading devices are proposed to increase daylight availability in the Yaşar University Faculty of Architecture Temporary Studio, which has a deep plan layout and receives daylight only from the southeast facade. The objective was to meet the LEED daylight evaluation requirements for each zone, which require sDA to be at least 55% and ASE to be at most 10% in the selected analysis area. To propose TDGS and movable shadings with the most efficient angles and positions; Rhinoceros, Grasshopper, and Climate Studio were used, and simulation results were validated by real-time measurements. The design proposal simulation results achieved a significant increase in daylight availability in the rear part of the room (zone 2-3), while glare was diminished near the façade (zone1). The proposed design strategy improved daylight availability through the room, demonstrating that the systems perform well together.",

A plenum has been added to the air inlet geometry in line with the goal of low flow distortion and high pressure recovery. Then, the optimum plenum geometry design was obtained by applying a two-stage optimization process. In each optimization step, computational fluid dynamics analyses were performed to define the effects of the changes in the geometric dimensions of the plenum design and bleed system on the PR (Pressure Recovery) and FD (Flow Distortion) values. The outcome of the analysis showed that the addition of the plenum and the bleed system improved the performance of the air inlet.

Breast screening makes extensive use of powerful techniques such as x-ray mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, and ultrasonography. While these technologies have numerous benefits, certain drawbacks such as the use of low-energy ionizing x-rays, a lack of specificity for malignant tissues, and cost, have motivated researchers to investigate novel imaging and detection modalities. Microwave imaging (MWI) has been extensively studied due to its low-cost structure and ability to perform measurements using non-ionizing electromagnetic waves. This study proposes a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting and classifying tumor scatterers in MWI simulation data. To accomplish this, 10001 different numerical breast models with tumor scatterers of varying numbers and positions were developed, and the simulation results were derived using the synthetic aperture radar (SAR) technique. The presented CNN structure was trained using 8000 pieces of simulation data, and the remaining data were used for testing, achieving accuracy rates of 99.61% and 99.75%, respectively. The proposed model is compared to three state-of-the-art models on the same dataset in terms of classification performance. The results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively performs effectively well in detecting and classifying tumor scatterers.",

The coefficient of performance (COP) of this heat pump system has been calculated as 3,88. Due to heat pump integration, the drying system saved 36.839,1 Nm3 of natural gas annually. Considering the annual operating time of the system, electricity, and natural gas unit costs; this integration predicted that the system would provide 193,501.25 ₺/year financial savings to its owner. Within the parameters, equipment and installation price, current dollar exchange rate and annual financial savings, the heat pump system amortization period was calculated as 1,50 years.

For this purpose, systems with various sensors are being developed. Extracting information from the data provided by the sensors is also important for the most efficient use of the hardware. Radar systems are frequently used for reconnaissance, surveillance and detection purposes. There are rule-based and machine learning-based methods for the classification of objects detected by radar. In machine learning-based approaches, the characteristics of the target object are learned by the model over time without the need for expert opinion. For this reason, these methods are more advantageous than rule-based methods. In this study, target classification was made on unstable Doppler Radar data in order to distinguish UAVs from other objects. In experimental studies, the highest performance was obtained in the data set balanced using SMOTE, and %99,99 accuracy was achieved with the proposed CNN model.",

        "abstract": "In this study, a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to detect and resolve conflicts between aircraft in a generic free route airspace while minimizing the total flight distance. The proposed solution approach uses airspace partitioning technique to control safety separations and determine flight trajectories. However, defining too many nodes during the airspace partitioning phase allows for achieving high-quality solutions but also increases problem complexity and computation time. Therefore, the impact of the partitioning rate (number of nodes in the airspace) on the solution quality and time is investigated by partitioning the airspace into low, medium, and high node numbers. The experimental results indicate that a medium partitioning rate can achieve a significant improvement in solution quality within an acceptable computation time compared to a low rate, while a high partitioning rate results in a significant increase in computation time without providing an equivalent improvement in solution quality.",

In this study, the effects of knitting method and printing aspects on the strength of tensile test samples produced from polylactic acid (PLA) filament using a three-dimensional printer based on fused deposition modeling (FDM) were investigated. For this purpose, firs of all tensile test samples were first prepared according to ASTM D638 Type I standard and the samples were produced with three different knitting methods and the same occupancy rates, horizontal and vertical placement. Afterwards, all the samples produced were examined in terms of deformation, elongation rate, maximum load, yield strength, tensile strength and tensile strength. It has been observed that horizontally placed test samples can withstand more maximum load than vertically placed test samples. It was observed that the highest tensile strength value in terms of tensile strength (21,242 MPa) was for vertically placed samples with gyroid knitting method, while the lowest tensile strength value (17,262 MPa) belonged to test samples produced horizontally with rectilinear knitting method.",

        "abstract": "In medium-length power transmission line models, the difference between the end-of-line and head-of-line voltage can be calculated with classical mathematical expressions. However, since the line parameters are not linear, these calculations can be approximated according to certain assumptions. The parametric data analysis approach proposed in this study obtained a data set for different variations by changing the line length and line parameters (transmission line specific parameters such as resistance, inductance, and capacitance) with certain steps. Then, using this data set, a classification is made with machine learning. In addition, data analysis is carried out with the end-of-line voltage value graphs obtained with different line parameters and the proposed approach is verified by constructing a test simulation circuit of a three-phase 200 km length with 154 kV line voltage value. Thus, a parametric simulation study has been presented, especially in electrical engineering education. In addition, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Decision Tree Regression (DTR) models in the field of machine learning were used to measure the consistency of the data set created for 5 pF, 8 pF and 10 pF capacity values. With the figures and numerical data presented comparatively, it is clearly seen that the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm produces more successful scores in all three categories. In this context, the prediction accuracy was between 97% and 98% with DTR, while the accuracy was between 81% and 85% with SVR. Thus, prediction results in the range of 98% - 99% were obtained in the LSTM model.",

The aim of this study was to ensure product safety by capturing the spot-welding quality, which is determined by the specifications of the automotive main industry, using a bolt with a lower weight. In this study, 1.5 mm WSS-M1A365-A11 uncoated steel sheet and 8.8 quality M6x1.00x25 triple projection uncoated welding bolts and 8.8 quality M6x1.00x18.5 ring shaped weld bolts were used as stud welding bolts. Different welding times, different welding currents and different welding clamping forces were used on the WSS-M1A365-A11 steel sheet samples in the stud welding operation with bolts. Taguchi analysis showed that ring shaped stud weld bolts required welding parameters of 32 ms welding time, 27 kA welding current and 500 daN welding force, while triple projection stud welding was found to perform the best optimum weld with 23 ms welding time, 18 kA welding current and 350 daN force.",

In this study, three intersections on a sequential corridor with an isolated control system in Elazig province were examined as an example. Traffic volume measurements were taken during peak hours of all days of the week using built-in cameras in this corridor. The existing geometry of the intersections, control forms, signal cycles, phase durations, and phase plans were also considered. The current situation of the intersections was analyzed and evaluated using microsimulation software (PTV Vissim). Offset times were determined by considering the average speed and distances between the intersections, and coordination was established between the intersections. Four different coordinated states were analyzed and evaluated using microsimulation software by making changes to the intersection geometry, phase, and cycle time diagrams. The delay, number of stops, service level, queue lengths, travel time, and average speed parameters were compared between the current situation and the four different coordinated situations created. As a result of the study, it was found that significant improvements (50% or more) were achieved in the performance criteria considered in the situations of coordinated control compared to the current situation, and these improvements had different values for each criterion and situation. Therefore, it was concluded that coordinated control of intersections instead of isolated controls would be beneficial for urban traffic management, and the reorganization of intersection geometries together with the signal timings and phase plans could contribute to corridor management.",

Therefore, the research on the use of green solvents to replace the traditional ones have gained wide interest.1-phenylethanol is one of the important chiral building blocks which are used for producing fine chemicals in several industries. In this work, it was aimed to produce enantiomerically pure 1-phenylethanol in the green solvent media. Accordingly, propylene carbonate (PC), dimethyl carbonate (DMC) and 2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MeTHF) were used. Best results were obtained by using DMC. 100% enantiomeric excess for the substrate (ees) and 50% conversion were reached with 240 mM substrate concentration, 20 mg/mL lipase concentration and 3 hours reaction time at 40℃ and 250 rpm. In this work; DMC, which is characterized as “one of the greenest solvents”, was used as the reaction solvent for the first time in the enzymatic kinetic resolution of racemic 1-phenylethanol. When compared with the literature, in which both traditional and other green solvents were used, it was observed that DMC can replace these solvents, considering its advantageous properties such as low eco-toxicity, high biodegrability and low cost, together with its high ees and conversion values.",

Castings obtained in real conditions have been modelled using 3D SOLIDCast casting simulation software. During modelling, different CFS values have been used as a boundary condition in simulation, and the volumes of the shrinkage voids were compared as a function of real castings and simulation.

Thus, comprehensive land use plans developed integrating water quality models would certainly provide better solutions for the sustainability of natural water resources. In this study, the inner bay of Fethiye, located along the south-west coast of Turkey, is selected as a case to identify the land use and water quality relationship. At six locations in the Bay, various physical and chemical parameters (e.g. temperature, density, salinity, pH, concentrations of dissolved oxygen, nitrite, nitrate and total dissolved solid) were monitored by monthly field and laboratory measurements for four months during summer and autumn seasons. The measured nitrite, nitrate and dissolved oxygen concentrations were then compared with the estimations of the water quality sub model of HYDROTAM-3D, which is an implicit baroclinic 3D numerical model developed to simulate hydrodynamics, transport processes and basic water quality parameters in coastal waters. The paper presents results on monitored water quality parameters and model estimations, and discusses the sea water quality of the inner bay of Fethiye emphasizing the impacts of land use patterns in the town",

In this study, how using waste marble dust affects durability of concrete-which is one measure of sustainability is researched in carbonation factor. Determining carbonation depth of concrete-which blended waste marble dust (WMD) that substituted with cement at different rates-is taken as a goal. For this goal, four different concrete mix –with the same slump- substituted with 0%, 5%, 10% and 15% WMD is prepared. 28 days standard cured samples were exposed to carbonation for 56 days and their carbonation depths were measured. Samples which has become carbonated and not carbonated, tested with ultrasonic pulse velocity, and their capillary coefficent, compressive strength and abrasion resistance are determined. As a result, carbonation mostly seen in sample which contains 15% WMD. After the carbonation experiment, it’s obtained that as WMD amount increases, carbonation depth and compressive strength increases; and it’s also obtained that abrasion resistance and capillary coefficient decreases. Furthermore, on the purpose of reducing environmental pollution, it’s reached that optimum substitution percent of WMD in concrete production is 5% and the optimum usage of WMD affects sustainability of concrete positively",

Capillary valves are preferred especially in passive microfluidic systems, where the capillary forces dominate the liquid motion, to manipulate the flow. The capillary valve in this work, was formed by the sudden expansion of a rectangular microchannel to an opening, whose depth and width are larger than the height and the width of the channel respectively. Noting that there was no available analytical model to determine the pressure capacity of such valves, a numerical model based on energy minimization was utilized. Free software Surface Evolver was used to solve the model. Dependence of the pressure capacity on the contact angle of the working liquid on the channel material was investigated. It was found that the pressure capacity of the valves would be maximum if the contact angle on all surfaces is 90o. Accordingly, the valves could withstand approximately 2.5 kPa for 100 µm × 100 µm channels when the contact angle was 90o. The model was verified by comparing the results with those available in the literature",

Three different cutting techniques were used in the studied quarry. The first one is called Method A which is the standard diamond wire cutting method. In this method; bottom, side and rear cuttings are carried out by diamond wires passing through drilled holes perpendicular to each other. Secondly, the rear is cut with chain saw machine with the length of 7.40m while the bottom and side cuttings are achieved through diamond wires. This is called Method B. The third method, Method C, operates by cutting the bottom with chain saw machine with the length of 3.40m. The side and rear are cut with diamond wire in this method. All three methods operated in the quarry are evaluated with the data taken for approximately 4 months. During this period, 159.60 m drilling and 3357.55 m2 cutting have been done in order to achieve the volume increase of 3848.68 m3. During the operations; the usage of machines, drilling / cutting speed, supplies consumption and labour force are observed and this data is evaluated in terms of production method and type of machinery. As a result of this research, the fastest method was discovered as Method B while the fastest cutting machine was determined as chain saw machine with the length of 7.40m. Moreover; it is found that in order to increase efficiency, areas that are cut must be as large as it can get",

In this paper, a numerical model based on the finite difference method is presented to predict the temperature between tool and chip interface in continuous machining process. Continuous or steady-state machining operations in orthogonal cutting are studied by modeling the heat transfer between the tool and chip at the tool rake face contact zone. The shear energy created in the primary zone, the friction energy produced at the rake face chip contact zone in the secondary zone and the heat balance between the moving chip and stationary tool are considered. The primary and secondary zone temperature distribution was solved by a computer program written in FORTRAN using finite difference method. The mathematical model and simulation results are satisfactory compared with experimental measurements reported in the literature.",

Parallel to the general tendency, national use of resources in the construction industry has become more and more important the field of construction comprises of various sorts of production processes and each process require a number of different resources (labour, machinery and equipment, materials, finance, etc). Accordingly, a construction project, in many cases, may prove to be complicated and huge in terms of contents. When undertaking these projects, difficulties in providing the required amount of a specific resource at the required time are likely to arise. Consequently, a strict policy of planning for the use of resources is essential. In this work various methods of programming have been worked out with a special emphasis on the cases of limited resources and the application of the algorithms employed, work according to the principle of priorities rule. The prime priority of the fist algorithm is putting all the activities, from the start to the end, into an order of decreasing lengths of period duration. The one with a shorter time of resource abundance takes the urgency. The activities with shortest duration are given the third place in terms of urgency. In the second algorithm, the resource with the least abundance, was given the first priority whereas the are with a longer duration was considered to be of a lesser priority and the activity of the shortest run was third. The both algorithms were applied on the construction works of a bridge and their performances were investigated. Under the conditions of unlimited resource, the construction was to be completed in 46 days whereas, one excavator, 80.0 of concrete template, 10 tons of iron, 10.0 m3 of concrete and 15 workers, on the daily basic, a delay of 12 days was inevitable with the both algorithms",

In power control systems, to get the RMS value of an alternative voltage is very important. In case of the voltage being applied to charge is sinusoid, the measurement of the voltage and transferring it to the valuing module are performed by simple circuit arrangements. However, deformations of sinus signal or control operations relating phase angle, to measure the voltage applied to charge and to transfer it to the valuing module pose a problem. Particularly in power control circuits relating phase angle, the output voltage is expected to be stable. In these sorts of systems, acquiring a stable output voltage is feasible via pretty fast and accurate measurement results. This paper sets its sights on developing a microcontroller based true RMS value scale system which will be used in control systems deleted to the phase angle, which can measure with sensitivity of average % 0,4 and which is convenient for using in high power applications",

Four types ofeffects on the bar are investigated. These are effects of temperaturevariation, geometric ratio, slenderness ratio and mode numbers variation. Thetemperature is increased from 22°Cto 250°C.The geometric ratio is varied from 0 to -1/L at intervals of 0.25/L. Theslenderness ratio is varied from 1/10 to 1/20 by increasing the length of barfrom 200 mm to 400 mm. As for the mode numbers, the first three mode shapes areexamined in the analysis. The boundary condition of the bar is taken asclamped-free. According to the results, the natural frequency decreases withincreasing the temperature. The natural frequency also decreases withdecreasing the slenderness ratio. But, it increases with decreasing thegeometric ratio and also increases with increasing the mode number.

Inthis study, biochar which is used as an adsorbent has been produced fromhazelnut shells used as the raw material. Chemical, thermal and surfacecharacteristics of raw hazelnut shell were investigated by FT-IR, TG/DTG, SEMand elemental analysis. Biochar characteristics were determined by FT-IR, BETand SEM analysis. The effect of different adsorption parameters such as pH,initial dye concentration, contact time, adsorbent dosage and temperature onthe adsorption of MB onto hazelnut shell char were examined in batchexperiments. The equilibrium of adsorption was modeled using Langmuir andFreundlich isotherm models. The maximum adsorption yield of MB was found to be83% at pH 4.0, adsorbent dosage of 4 g/L, contact time of 300 min., initial dyeconcentration of 15 mg/L and temperature of 45oC. In addition, theFreundlich isotherm was found to be the best fitting isotherm model for theadsorption process.

However, most of these reactions raise severeenvironmental and safety problems, while availability of raw materials is acritical problem. One of the partial solutions is solar hydrogen. It appearsthat cracking of carbon-rich materials is the right solution for this energy.In this context comes this numerical simulation of the methane crackingphenomenon. In the simulation, we have taken in to account the existence ofcarbon as a homogeneous powder. The mixture is considered to be biphasic formedby a gaseous phase with methane, hydrogen gases and carbon black powder solidphase. This powder is formed by solid particles with same diameter (d=50nm).The cracking phenomenon of the methane into hydrogen and carbon black takesplace in a cylindrical cavity of 16 cm in diameter and 40 cm in length underthe heat of concentrated solar radiation without any catalyst. A commercialcalculation code \"ANSYS FLUENT\" is used to simulate the crackingphenomena. Two cases were studied: the first one applying a maximum solarradiation of 16MW/m2on the side wall of the reactor and the secondone a maximum solar radiation of 5 MW/m2. The CH4flowrate used at the inlet of the reactor is 0.4 L/min and the low Reynolds K - εturbulence model was applied. A time step of 0.04s has been used.The crackingrate exceeds 90% with a maximum solar radiation of 16MW/m2and thisrate does not reach 85% with a maximum solar radiation of 5MW/m2.Thedimensions of the cavity are important and it allows going from theexperimental scale to the industrial scale. Working without any catalystfacilitates the separation of the elements after cracking.",

Selecting an optimal threshold valueis one of the most crucial phase in image thresholding. While bi-levelsegmentation contains separating the original image into subdivided sectionswith help of a threshold value, multilevel segmentation involves multithreshold values. Especially in multilevel image tresholding, the computationaltime of detailed search increases exponentially with the number of preferredthresholds. For compelling problems, swarm intelligence is known as one of thesuccessful and influential optimization methods. In this paper, the grey wolfoptimizer (GWO), a recently proposed swarm-based meta-heuristic which imitatesthe social leadership and hunting behavior of gray wolves in nature is employedfor solving the multilevel image thresholding problem. The experimental resultson standard benchmark images indicate that the grey wolf optimizer algorithm iscomparable with other state of the art algorithms.",

Microstructural characterization as-cast alloy demonstrated that wt.% Ca content increase, grain size decreases till wt.% 0.8Ca, the further increase affects gradual change in grain size to ~60 µm at 345°C. Therefore,  increase in Ca ratio from 0.4 wt% forming to strip-like Mg-Zn intermetallics at grain boundaries, Ca-Mg-Zn ternary phase at grain boundary corners. Dramatical decrease in yield and tensile strength at  wt% 1.6Ca addition is 37.6 MPa and 39.7 MPa respectively which is relatively low at 345°C due to the absence of retarded DRX’ed small particles prohibited the grain growth after the TMT process. Conversely, elongation-to-fracture increases were observed as 1.26 at 345°C showing the temperature-dependent texture softening results in improvement of mechanical properties. Wear rate is also affected from wt.% Ca addition so the gradual increase up to 1.2 wt% Ca is 3.70 x 10-3 mm3/m.

The proposed methodology is demonstrated and verified by conducting random finite element modeling (RFEM) of an instrumented deep excavation project situated in Ankara, Turkey. The excavation has a depth of 20 meters and is supported by six levels of pre-stressed ground anchors. To simulate the vertical spatial variability of effective stress friction angle in the clay, Monte Carlo simulation method and the random field theory are employed. The simulated parameters are then inserted into the finite element model via Python programming language to analyze the probabilistic distribution of lateral deflections and bending moments in the drilled shaft wall. The results obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations reveal that the incorporation and selected value of spatial variability significantly impacts the resulting lateral movements, bending moments, and the probability of failure of the system.",

The study is verified with published COP data of the manufacturer. Results are shared with graphs that give the variation of refrigerant evaporation and condensation temperature and pressure, COP, and condenser heating load according to outdoor air temperature. A raise from -10°C to 18°C in outdoor temperature, increases the COP value from 3.38 to 5.49. Detection of the increase in evaporation pressure in parallel with the outdoor temperature may allow easy control of the refrigerant charge level with a manometer.

To this end, the long-term annual total precipitation and average annual maximum temperature series were obtained from Sanliurfa, Birecik, Akcakale, Ceylanpinari, Siverek for the years 1965-2020 and Bozova (2000-2020) meteorological observation stations. Based on the data obtained, “Erinç Drought/Aridity Index” (EDI) values calculated annually for each station; the runs (Swed-Eisenhart), autocorrelation, Mann-Kendall trend and Sen's slope tests were applied at 5% significance level. According to the runs and autocorrelation tests, it was determined that the EDI (Im) series were statistically independent. Median values of the EDI series, Mann-Kendall trend test (Z) and Sen's slope (Q) statistics for each meteorological station were utilized to produce \"Mann-Kendall Trend\", \"Sen's Slope Trend\" and \"Erinç Drought Index\" maps by the Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation technique in the Geographical Information System environment. Consequently, it has been determined that the EDI values show a significant downward trend from north to south in and around Sanliurfa; the magnitude of trend, i.e. its speed, (Im/year) tends to increase in the direction of decreasing land elevation. Not surprisingly, the closer to the Syrian border, the more severe the drought episodes. Research results led us to conclude that Atatürk, Birecik and Karkamis dams can not be expected to prevent the spatial and temporal propagation of the drought from north to south in Sanliurfa, except for Bozova district.",

        "abstract": "Distributed energy resources (DERs) are a better choice to meet load demand close to load centers. Optimal DER placement and DER ratings lead to power loss reduction, voltage profile improvement, environmental friendliness, dependability, and postponement of system changes. This study uses artificial neural networks and the Chameleon Optimization Algorithm to analyze the best integration of renewable energy sources and electric vehicles in distribution feeders to reduce power loss, regulate voltage levels, and decrease the cost and emissions under unpredictable load demand. In this study, the generated output power of the models is compared to solar photovoltaic generation systems and wind turbine generation systems. As a result, a fitness function with several objectives has been developed to reduce total active power loss while also reducing total cost and emissions generation. The study took into account the influence of EV charging/discharging behavior on the distribution system. The 28-bus rural distribution network in feeders is used to test the suggested methodology. Final analysis of the numerical results showed that the Artificial Neural Network and Chameleon Optimization Algorithms outperformed in terms of power loss (440.94 kw) and average purchase of real power (2224 kw), but these parameters do not favor the other optimization algorithms. This showed that the proposed strategy is both viable and effective.",

        "abstract": "Using field-specific design turbine-generator equipment in rural areas and projects with hydraulic resources at micro scale reduces accessibility by increasing investment costs. Another alternative for projects that want to generate electricity with usable performance with limited financial resources is to use the standard centrifugal pump-motor set as a turbine-generator. This study aimed to design a load control system that can keep the energy quality deterioration in variable load situations within the desired limits and at the same time be installed with low cost, while the standard centrifugal pump-motor set is independent from the grid as a turbine-generator and feeding single-phase loads. It is focused on the use of a three-phase self-excited induction generator to feed one-phase loads, which has the advantage of easy excitation and stable operation, thus reducing the number and cost of the elements in the load control system. PID algorithm has been created to enable the ballast load of the load control system to a stabile operation at the calculated power. MATLAB SIMULINK program was used to test the design in computer environment. Then, the physical performance tests of the system, which was established in the experimental set environment, were also performed. The results of the measurements showed that the designed load control card keeps the generator output voltage and frequency at the desired output voltage and frequency, which reduces the change in the generator output voltage frequency from 16% to 1% and the voltage change from 34% to 3% during load changes. It has been determined that the response time of the load control card is between 40 and 150 ms during load shedding and unloading.",

Studies on stress concentrations have been conducted in the past using a variety of theoretical and experimental methodologies, and distinct interpretations have been offered depending on the geometry of the machine part to be produced. The ability to complete activities with the least amount of effort and in the shortest amount of time has emerged as a result of the new computer technologies and software that have impacted many aspects of our everyday lives. One of these methods is the artificial neural networks (ANN) model, which is a branch of artificial intelligence. It is argued as a thesis in this study that fast and low-cost solutions can be found to problems in the field of solid mechanics by using the ANN model. For this purpose, a model has been developed to determine the SCF value with the ANN model of a plate with symmetrical V-shaped notch. The graphs obtained from previous experimental studies were converted to digital format and the Kt values obtained for the V-shaped notch problem with different parameters were converted into a data file. In this file, the SCF values to be obtained according to the strength upper limit safety factor value of the machine part, depending on the dimensional dimensions and material type required for the design, are calculated numerically in the form of an Excel file. An ANN-based code was created in MATLAB software and a new solution method was presented for parts containing a V-shaped notch.",

These materials, which are obtained mostly by the production of composite materials, enable the production of lighter, more durable and less costly products. Increasing environmental pollution in recent years, protection of natural resources and ensuring recycling have increased the importance of wood plastic composite material production. In this study, wood plastic composite material was obtained by using ABS (Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) plastic material and six different fruit shell powders (walnut, pistachio, peanut, almond, hazelnut and apricot shell). The mechanical properties of the obtained composite material were determined and its effect on the I type snap-fits was analyzed in ANSYS software. When the resulting composite material's mechanical properties were tested, it was found that the density and tensile strength decreased while the Vicat softening point value and melt flow rate increased. In the analysis performed using the ANSYS software, it was found that the composite I type snap-fit design of the same size can resist 12.6% N less force when the material is subjected to its maximum values when it achieves the elongation at break value.",

When reviewing the studies carried out so far, Aluminium Hydroxide Al(OH)3 (ATH), Magnesium Hydroxide Mg(OH)2 (MDH) were found to be used as Halogen-Free Flame Retardant (HFFR) materials. In addition to these two compounds, the study was carried out with three flame retardant materials by using the flame retardant property of the Zinc Borate compound. In the study, the design of the experimental method was used to optimize the maximum tensile strength, elongation and Limiting Oxygen Index (LOI) of composites and define the most suitable composition. Linear Low-Density Polyethylene (LLDPE) and Ethylene Vinyl Acetate (EVA) were used as polymer matrices. The weight percent of Al(OH)3, Mg(OH)2, ZnB2O4 compounds were taken to be input variables, and the maximum tensile strength, elongation, and Limiting Oxygen Index values of the composites to be output variables for using in ECHIP-7 software that is a design of experiment program. At the end of the study, 40 %w of polymer, 30%w of ATH, and 30%w MDH was selected to be an optimum composition for the HFFR sheath material. Given the optimum parameters criteria, it was also seen that there is no need for Zinc Borate usage in the optimum composition. The optimum composition was used as cable sheath material, and electrical, mechanical, and burning tests were applied to the produced new cable.",

Due to these situations, different malware attacks are discussed in the study, and the effects of attacks on Windows security are examined. A test-bed called AyEs has been prepared. Different attacks have been carried out, such as screenshots, vnc, aimed at hijacking or corrupting the victim system. The AyEs dataset was created by listening to the system network packets obtained due to the attacks. The dataset was preprocessed and made suitable for analysis. Machine learning methods such as Naive Bayes, J48, BayesNet, IBk, AdaBoost and LogitBoost were used on the dataset to detect malware attacks. J48 and IBk methods, which were found to provide high performance as a result of the analyzes, were suggested in the study.

This study investigates the technical, economic, and environmental impacts of changes in energy costs and incentives on hybrid power systems (HPS). Optimization results show optimal HPSs vary between 75-200% penetration (PR) depending on grid energy tariffs and energy sales constraints (GSC). In these scenarios, the renewable fraction (RF) increased to 80%, while the excess electricity (EE) increased to 10%. On the other hand, energy tariffs and grid constraints limit the PR increase in the optimal scenarios. This reduced the RF by up to 26%, limiting the use of clean energy. Due to load mismatch and grid constraints, there was a minimal increase in RF after 200% PR. In addition, removing incentives increased the cost of energy (COE) and total net present costs (NPC) by up to 96%. The results show that grid constraints and energy tariffs directly affect the economic and environmental performance of renewable energy investments and can slow down the pace of these investments. Moreover, it has become clear that controlled incentive packages must continue to achieve zero carbon targets.",

In recent years, MRSA bacteria are detected by the bacterial culture and nucleic acid-based methods which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, a novel liquid crystal (LC)-based biosensing system was developed to overcome these limitations. The objective of this study was to detect the presence of MRSA bacteria which prepared within the isotonic water and phosphate buffer saline (PBS). In this system, the binding of MRSA bacteria to the dimethyloctadecyl [3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl] ammonium chloride (DMOAP)-coated surface disrupted the orientation of LCs, triggering a transition from a homeotropic orientation to a random one. This transition in the orientation of the LCs was observed as a change from a dark optical LC image to a bright one under a polarized light microscope (POM) and the reflection values of LC molecules were determined by using a spectrometer. Through this sensing mechanism, MRSA bacteria prepared within the isotonic water was detected ranging from the 9.2x103 CFU/mL to 9.2x107 CFU/mL concentration. Furthermore, MRSA bacteria prepared in PBS was detected in the concentration range of 7.1x104 CFU/mL to 7.1x108 CFU/mL by using this system.",

        "abstract": "The current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) modeling strategy still suffers from huge performance degradation when faced with languages with limited resources such as Turkish. Especially when the Language Model (LM) does not support the Acoustic Model (AM) sufficiently, the Word Error Rate (WER) increases. Therefore, a robust LM makes a strong contribution to improving ASR performance by generating word relations from the existing corpus. However, developing a robust language model is a challenging task due to the agglutinative nature of Turkish. Therefore, within the scope of the study, a sentence-level LM optimization method is proposed to improve the WER performance of Turkish ASR. In the proposed method, instead of a fixed word sequence obtained from the Markov assumptions, the probability of the word sequence forming a sentence was calculated. A method with n-gram and skip-gram properties is presented to obtain the word sequence probability. The proposed method has been tested on both statistical and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) based LMs. In the experiments carried out using, not only words but also sub-word level, two Turkish corpora (METU and Bogazici) shared via Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) and a separate corpus, which we separate corpus that we specially created as HS was used. According to the experimental results obtained from statistical-based LM, 0.5% WER increases for the METU corpus, 1.6% WER decreases for the Bogazici corpus, and a 2.5% WER decrease for the HS corpus were observed. In the Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) based LM, WER decreases were observed 0.2% for the METU corpus, 0.8% for the Bogazici corpus, and 1.6% for the HS corpus. Also, in the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based LM, WER decreases were observed 0.6% for METU corpus, 1.1% for the Bogazici corpus and 1.5% for the HS corpus. As a result, when the proposed method was applied to the LMs required for ASR, WER decreased, and the total performance of ASR increased.",

Object detection from images is used as a tool for various applications and is the basis of video classification. Objects in videos are more difficult to identify than in single images, as the information in videos has a time-continuity constraint. Following the developments in the field of computer vision, the use of open source software packages for machine learning and deep learning and the developments in hardware technologies have enabled the development of new approaches. In this study, a deep learning-based classification model has been developed for the classification of sports branches in video. In the model developed using CNN, transfer learning has been applied with VGG-19. Experimental studies on 32827 frames using CNN and VGG-19 models showed that VGG-19 has a more successful classification performance than CNN with an accuracy rate of 83%.",

Especially in the last 10 years, with the proliferation of desktop type 3D printers in the additive manufacturing sector, thermoplastics have become the most widely used plastic material. Therewith, the assembly of materials produced by this method has gained so much importance. Since plastic materials have low surface energy, there are difficulties in performing the adhesive bonding process, which is a popular joining method, and some issues (adhesive type, surface cleaning, etc.) should be carefully considered. In this study; PLA sheets were produced by means of additive manufacturing method and joined with two different adhesives (Loctite 9492 and Terason 9225). For surface preparation, mechanical sanding was performed using 320 and 600 grit size SiC sandpaper. Adhesive bonding joints were created from PLA-PLA material with three different adhesive thicknesses (0.3, 0.18 and 0.1mm). Joints were subjected to tensile test and their mechanical properties were examined. The results showed that high fill ratio in 3D printing increases the strength of parts. In addition, the strength of the adhesively bonded surfaces is affected by the variation of the adhesive thickness and the adhesive type. Whilst an increase in the adhesive thickness increases the strength of Loctite EA 9492 joints; just an opposite effect in Teroson PU 9225 joints was observed.",

A torque control strategy has been developed for the hybrid vehicle on the created model. The hybrid vehicle's torque control is provided by fuzzy logic and conventional rule-based control strategies. The control strategies of the hybrid vehicle have been developed based on four input parameters: accelerator and brake pedal position, battery state of charge and the operating mode of the electric motor. The regenerative braking system of the pre-transmission parallel hybrid vehicle has been provided with a fuzzy logic control strategy in both vehicle structures. In the fuzzy logic torque split controller, a control algorithm has been created in which the safety, performance and fuel consumption values of the vehicle meet at the optimum point. Under different driving cycle conditions, the effects of control strategies on engine operating points have been examined and average fuel consumption values have been obtained. In the control of the parallel hybrid vehicle with fuzzy logic method, it has been obtained that it provides 12.87%, 6.62%, 2.27% and 6.23% fuel savings under FTP-75, NEDC, EUDC and ECE-15 driving cycle conditions, respectively. It has been observed that the vehicle cannot provide sufficient performance in US06 driving cycle conditions with the use of conventional rule-based control strategy.",

This situation occurs as a result loading chip volume two cutter blades in drilling with drill. However, a much smaller chip volume loaded distributed nearby many different angles cutter blades to reaming (keeping a very small share of reaming). Surface quality improved as a result of reaming that, acting at different angles, cutting edges, does not follow the traces of of each other and the circularity is guaranteed due to the volume of a very small chip. Thus, geometrically important in applications where the circularity secondary process such as reaming inevitable to drilled holes with drill.

The 7-link model consists of the trunk, two thighs, two shanks and two feet links. The movement is examined in the sagittal plane and during the single support phase (SSP). Unlike the rotation about a fixed point, it is assumed that the right foot rotates about the center of pressure (COP). The part between the COP and the tip of the toe is considered to be a passive limb which is horizontally on the ground. The effect of this part on dynamic analysis is neglected. The equations of motions are derived by applying Lagrange equations. Using the kinematic data obtained in clinical gait analysis (CGA) conducted by Winter [1], the net joint torques are calculated and then compared with CGA torque data.

To do so, PET fabric was aminated, and then the phenolics were immobilized using polyethylene glycol diglycidyl ether (PEGDGE) as the crosslinking agent. Formation of amine groups in PET structure and immobilization of the phenolics were proved by ATR-FTIR spectrums. Water contact angle of PET being 121° decreased to 110° and 97° after the amination and the immobilization, respectively. Optical microscope images were taken to monitor morphological changes after the processes. DSC results revealed a new endothermic peak at around 40 °C for modified PET. Tensile tests showed that tensile strength of the fabric weakens upon modification, while a healing effect occurs during immobilization. Antibacterial tests revealed that propolis extract immobilized fabric has an antibacterial activity against gram negative (E. coli) bacteria.",

It is considered that there are two separate scenarios where user links are designed with one antenna and two antenna systems. In the study, Monte-Carlo simulations were carried out to understand the effects of using the A-STBC technique in UAV-Assisted NOMA-Based communication networks and increased antenna diversity in receiver and transmitter in the network to the performance of the system. For the benchmark, the downlink NOMA network was used, where the receivers and the UAV are designed with a single antenna.  In the simulation results, with the A-STBC technique in the system and increase in diversity, the effects of Path Loss (PL) and environmental factors on error performance were examined. Especially in high Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) values, it has been observed that the effects of these destructive factors on error performance are highly minimized. Also, the use of A-STBC technique and the increase in diversity in the system provided considerable SNR gain. Moreover, it has been observed that full diversity gain can be achieved when the A-STBC technique is used in the UAV-Assisted downlink NOMA-Based communication system.",

The Taguchi method is a statistical approach that helps us to optimize the process parameters and help us to save time in terms of labor and cost. In this study, the optimization of the design parameters by using the Taguchi method for the design of the C-type snap-fit connection, which is one of the flexing fasteners used in many areas of the industry, was investigated. The design and analysis of the study was carried out by using ANSYS software. The design parameters were optimized and the effective parameters were determined. ANOVA analysis was performed to determine the effective parameters. In addition, full factorial analysis was performed to verify the method used. For example, the optimum normal stress value obtained with the Taguchi array was obtained for the combination of H1=0.4;R1=3;α1=40;α2=89;y=6 and material is PLA. When we examine the table in Figure 4, we can see that the result of 328740.27 among 729 test results and the result of the parameters in the Taguchi set match.",

There are many types of prostheses that were developed in recent years. Prostheses can compensate many limb losses, upper body prostheses can be for not only finger losses but also full arm losses. Finger losses are the most common limb losses. Finger prostheses are imitating the functionality of human fingers. However most of the finger prostheses are only for cosmetic purposes and non-functional. On the other hand, the most of the functional prostheses are not perfectly fit to the users and are not designed personalised. Another big problem, some prostheses need a surgical operation to apply. The main purpose of this study is to design a finger prosthesis that is a perfect fit to user (personalised), easy to apply (does not required surgical operation), accessible (easy to manufacture) and sustainable. In this study, finger prosthesis was modelled based on human hand skeleton structure from computerized tomography (CT) images. Index finger distal and middle phalanges bones were removed from the hand model to simulate finger losses. Finger prosthesis was created on the modelled skeleton structure. Hand skeleton model and newly designed prosthesis were assembled by using CAD software. The designed prosthesis movement capability was examined, parts size and connections were optimised. Gripping ability of the designed prosthesis were analysed by kinematic analyses and a new mathematic model was developed. Created mathematic model can be use at other user’s prosthesis, in this way analyses are not required for new designs, user parameters and measurements are enough to future designs manufacturs. Joint rotation rates were set to grip 40 mm diameter cylinder. The gripping ability of the newly designed finger prosthesis was analysed. Mechanical structure and movement abilities of the prosthesis were confirmed by experiments and measurements. Gripping tests are show that, designed and optimised prosthesis capable to grip perfectly 38-42 mm diameter cylinder. Smaller object also can be moved using prosthesis finger tips.",

The calculated risk scores may differ due to the unique characteristics of each of the risk assessment techniques. Moreover, there are various situations where different answers can be given, such as the level of OHS knowledge required in the application of the techniques, the technical details, whether the techniques require teamwork, whether the technique includes preliminary preparation processes. Since the results of risk assessment are directly related to the measures to be taken regarding human life, it becomes an important decision problem according to which criteria should be considered in selection of the risk analysis technique. On the other hand, considering that all kinds of work carried out in enterprises require bearing a cost, the selection of the method is also an important decision for economic reasons. In the light of these explanations, in this paper, a study was conducted to determine the relative importance of the selection criteria of the risk analysis technique. Analytical Hierarchy Process, one of the most frequently used multi-criteria decision-making techniques, was utilized while calculating the relative importance weights of the criteria. As a result, the most important main criterion and sub criterion were determined as the technical criterion, and the sensitivity of the evaluation scale, respectively.",

Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, long-chained)), tetraethylammonium bromide (TEAB, short-chained)), and benzyltriethylammonium bromide (BTEAB, ringed)) surfactants were employed to modify the clay surfaces to obtain organoclay. Organoclays were labelled as CTAB-O (clay modified with cetyltrimethylammonium bromide), BTEAB-O (clay modified with benzyltriethylammonium bromide) and TEAB-O (clay modified with tetraethylammonium bromide). The structural and thermal properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). XRD and TEM results showed that exfoliated structure was formed for clay-chitosan composites and also organoclay-chitosan composites at lower CTAB-O, TEAB-O and BTEAB-O content. However, by increasing the organoclay content, tactoid morphology was obtained for organoclay-chitosan composites. Moreover, exfoliated structure was observed for clay-triethyl chitosan (TEC) and organoclay-triethyl chitosan (TEC) composites containing 2.5%, 5%, 10% clays and organoclays respectively. Thermal degradation temperature for 10% clay-chitosan and some organoclay-chitosan composites (5% and 10% TEAB-O-chitosan; 10% BTEAB-O-chitosan) increased (about 375 °C) with regard to neat chitosan (350 °C) at 50% weight loss. Furthermore, it was observed that thermal degradation temperature of TEC composites (clay-TEC, organoclay-TEC) increased significantly in reference to composites with chitosan (clay-chitosan, organoclay-chitosan). In particular, maximum degradation temperature (965-968 ˚C) was reached for clay-TEC (2.5% and 10%), CTAB-O-TEC (5%) and BTEAB-O-TEC (5% and 10%) at 50% weight loss.",

The raw data set, which includes 40 authors and 3269 texts, was created from Turkish news websites and analyzed in pre-processing step. After, syntactic and structural analyses were done on the data and, in total, 6 different data sets were created. Each of the data sets was subjected to the feature selection process by using GA and ELA approach together. Each of the obtained data sets from the previous step was classified by using the ELA's bagging method which contains 5 different classifiers, namely, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree. After applying the aforementioned processes to the raw data, the author identification approach reached 89% accuracy. The combination of ELA and GA has a strong potential to identify the author of a text.",

The data augmentation is carried out by using an extreme learning machine autoencoders (ELM-AE). More specifically, the wavelet activation function is incorporated into the ELM-AE to develop a novel approach called WELM-AE. After data augmentation, a traditional ELM classifier is used in the prediction of the psychosocial risk levels of teachers. A dataset, which contains physiological factors, namely Electrocardiography (ECG), Electromyography (EMG), and Electroencephalography (EEG), is used to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. Classification accuracy is used as the evaluation metric. All coding is carried out in MATLAB, and a 99.9% accuracy score is obtained with the proposed method. A performance comparison is also carried out with some machine learning techniques, namely decision trees (DT), support vector machines (SVM), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN).

In the studies carried out so far, there are various noise that seriously affect the system, arising from the electronic elements in their structure and the environment in which they operate. In addition, depending on the coherence length and intensity of the light sources used, the effects such as unwanted interference in the reflection spectrum create noise.  Therefore, the reflection spectrum of the FBG sensor is noisy. In recent years, filtering techniques and curve fitting methods etc. have become increasingly important to reduce the effect of this noise. In this study, it is revealed the Hilbert transform approach enables the detection of the more accurate central wavelength of the FBG sensor. This approach is very practical. Because the Hilbert transform already acts as a filter, this approach does not require a filter design, decomposition levels, or any other complex process as in other methods. To demonstrate that the proposed approach improves the accuracy and measurement capability of the FBG temperature sensor, the Wavelet Denoising  Approach presented in the literature so far and the results of the proposed approach are compared. As a result, it is concluded that the Hilbert transform approach definitely follows better the true central Bragg wavelength values and shows smaller a relative error.",

The microstructures and corrosion properties of samples were investigated in saltwater media. The effects of production parameters on the microstructure and corrosion behavior were determined. It was observed that as the ratio of vermiculariser applied was increased, the vermicular graphite ratio and vermicularity was also increased. The matrix grain size decreased while the inoculant and pearlite phase ratio increased due to the addition of copper.

Analysis of reinforced concrete (RC) sections is carried out by complex iteration methods, depending on a large number of variables and nonlinear material models. Therefore, it is not practical to perform the moment-curvature relation by hand calculation. This problem has been solved to some extent with the development of discrete softwares performing cross section analysis, and the upskill to perform cross section analysis of some softwares. In this paper, a program has been developed that can analyze RC rectangular sections under the effect of axial load and biaxial bending. With this program, cross-section analysis of columns with varying cross-section properties was performed and moment-curvature relations were determined. These relations were transformed into a bi-linear moment-curvature relationship ignoring strain-hardening effect. Then yield curvature, failure curvature, and yield moment of the cross section were determined using these relationship. In the light of these data, an ANN model was trained by using input and output parameters. The results of analytical and the trained ANN model were compared. As a result, an ANN model is proposed to determine the relation of the moment-curvature of RC rectangular columns under biaxial bending.",

This study investigates the flow characteristics and velocity profile of distilled water, alumina nanofluid, and cobalt ferrite ferrofluid in a horizontal cylindrical heat pipe flowing in a laminar regime and being exposed to an external magnetic field. All of the simulations were performed with ANSYS Fluent MHD module, for a concentration of 2%, Reynolds number of 10, and Hartmann numbers of 25, 50, and 150. The velocity profiles, pressure drops, and flow characteristics are examined by varying the magnetic field intensity while keeping all other parameters constant. It is concluded that an external magnetic field causes a deterioration in the velocity profiles of the nanofluid, especially in cobalt ferrite, while it does not have a significant effect on water. When the magnitude of the magnetic field is increased by 2 times, it is seen that the velocity of the fluid decreases by 6% and increasing the magnetic field from 0 to 50 Tesla causes a deceleration rate of 9%, which leads to the conclusion that application of a magnetic field for the first time has a more significant slowing effect when comparing it to increasing the magnetic field. In addition, when a magnetic field of 50 Tesla is considered, the maximum velocity of alumina is lower than that of water by 5.10%, and the maximum velocity of cobalt ferrite is lower by 28.57%.",

As well as low roughness of the surface may reduce the adhesion of paints/coatings,  excess of paint/coating may lead to rusting as a result of insufficient of paint/coating also excessive use of paint/coating will cause increased costs. For these reasons, the surface of sheet material is desired an optimal level of roughness. Roughness profile is transferred to surface of sheet materials by special roughing rollers, commonly known as skin-pass rolling. Roughness profile transferred to the sheet material surface is influenced by the rolling parameters. In this experimental study, it was investigated effect of the reduction ratio, rolling speed, roll roughness, lubrication conditions and material thickness on the roughness transfer by skin-pass rolling to AISI 304 stainless steel sheet materials with high yield strength and elongation ability, which are used extensively in the automotive industry and the roughness distribution was evaluated with the help of material ratio curves. Roughness transfer ratio increased as the reduction ratio increased. Roughness transfer ratio decreased with increasing material thickness, roll roughness, under the conditions of using lubricant. It was concluded that the increase in rolling speed had no effect on the roughness transfer ratio. Also, it was concluded that a more homogeneous roughness distribution can be achieved by choosing low reduction ratio, low rolling speed, low roughness roll, thick material and lubrication conditions.",

        "abstract": "The sheet metal bending process plays an important role in sheet metal production and springback is an unintended consequence of this operation. If the bending die process is performed without knowing the amount of springback, it is difficult to produce parts within acceptable tolerance values. The springback behavior of the part to be bent also affects the size of the bending die. In particular, in the case of a 90° U bend die, the manufacturing cost of the bending die with the springback compensation method is high. Therefore, it is important to estimate the springback value at the design stage. In this work, the estimation of the amount of deformation to avoid springback value was performed using the thickness reduction method for high strength sheet metal. According to this study, the thickness reduction method can be used effectively in springback compensation. The estimation of the measurement accuracy at the design stage reduces the cost of the bending die and it is possible to produce parts within tolerance limits without much experimentation. The results showed that thickness reduction at the 0,2 t value was suitable to eliminate the springback value in the U-bending process. It has been found that experimental, empirical and finite element results are close to each other.",

Silica and the composite were characterized for microstructural studies, elemental composition and surface morphologies using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-Ray (EDX) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). The synthesized copper silica composite was studied for structural, compositional and mechanical properties. The results showed that the copper metal matrix composite reinforced with silica showed improved mechanical behavior and can be used in all such applications where light weight and better mechanical strength from copper metal are expected.

There are many studies investigates the methods to shorten the setting time of concrete. Especially in the recent years, there are accelerators developed to shorten concrete setting time without causing corrosion. However, the negative effect of accelerators on fresh concrete properties such as workability makes them difficult to use. In this study,  it is  aimed to produce a concrete mixture with high initial strength and workability by using an accelerator. However, it is highly difficult to determine proper ratio of the accelerator for the mixture without precasting significant number of concrete samples which requires time, manpower and material consumption. Therefore, Taguchi optimization is very useful method in order to reduce this number of samples and  effort. The optimum mixture has been achieved by performing the required tests applied to mixture designs obtained from Taguchi optimization.",

This type of analysis is made of multiple steps, starting from observing and understanding commonly occurring wind patterns at the designated site, followed by collection of data and finally analysis. The current paper is an extended study on the first two steps where several parameters such as wind’s average speed and its direction, as well as various changes such as short-term ones (or gusts), yearly, seasonal, and even daily changes, and height-related variations were collected. Since the above-mentioned parameters are site-specific, they can be accurately determined through on-site measurements during extended time periods. The site for this study is the city of Gharyan in Libya which was divided into four sub-locations. Data were gathered from meteorological stations located in the vicinity of the designated area in three-hours periods, and they were then used to recalculate wind’s real speed and height at a specific hub. Among the important calculation parameters were Weibull's distribution, average wind speed, annual capacity factor, and the annual energy factor, all of them required for each proposed site. The calculations of the annual capacity and energy factors are necessary for choosing the appropriate wind turbine, generally named Vestas (V60, 850kW). The current study clearly shows that some sites, in particular four locations in Ghayran where feasible annual energy, capacity factor, and acceptable power generation capacity were recorded have wind energy for civilian purposes.",

The alumina used in the study was obtained by roasting the aluminum chloride salt precipitated from the loaded solution obtained by HCl leaching of the pyrophyllite ore. The resulting alumina and commercial rutile mixture is intensively milled, shaped and sintered at different temperatures to produce aluminum titanate. The result of sintering is that aluminum titanate formation is at 1359 °C in the milled mixture and at 1367 °C in the unmilled mixture. Formation of aluminum titanate at a lower temperature than the unmilled mixture, much less presence of microcracks and lack of pores clearly demonstrate the effect of mechanical activation.

In the TBC system, the substrate material, metallic bonding and ceramic top coat materials used to protect against the major damage formation mechanisms such as oxidation and corrosion that may occur during service are the main elements that determine the life of the TBC system under usage conditions. In this study, NiCrAlY containing a metallic bonding coat and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) coating were produced using atmospheric plasma spray (APS) coating method. The TBC system produced was subjected to isothermal oxidation tests at 1150 °C and at 5, 25 and 50 hours of time period. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis was conducted before and after high temperature furnace tests in order to determine microstructural changes. The changes in the characteristics of the oxide structures formed in the metallic bonding and ceramic top coat interface structure based on time during the high temperature process have been studied and evaluated in detail. It has been observed that depending on the oxidation process, thermally grown oxide layer (TGO) structure is formed at the interface of the metallic bonding and ceramic top coat, and this layer, dependent on the increasing oxidation process, grows parabolically. It has been determined that the content and growth behavior of the TGO layer varies depending on the alloying elements in the bonding coat, except oxygen diffused from the surface to the interface.",

The non-linear heat transfer analysis is used and heat source is modeled with the Goldak’s double ellipsoidal distribution by using SYSWELD in the gas metal arc welding (GMAW) process. This study employs the finite element (FE) method to evaluate residual stresses and angular distortions. A series of FE simulations and corresponding experiments are performed to evaluate the depth of penetration in the cross sections, angular distortions that occur after welding, temperature distribution, and residual stresses. A coordinate measuring machine and a 3D non-contact scanning device are used to measure the angular distortions and displacement distributions, respectively. The results show that controlling welding process via simulations can significantly enhance the performance of process, and help to minimize distortions and decrease costly design errors.",

Machine learning techniques are faster and more consistent than manual scoring. Therefore, there is a need for an effective machine learning technique to classify EEG data. Because of the success of modeling nonlinear data, Support Vector Machines (SVM), which is a supervised learning algorithm, is preferred. This success is achieved only when the appropriate kernel function is selected. Commonly used kernel functions are linear, polynomial and radial based (RBF). Since the nature of the data is not known in advance, it is difficult to make appropriate selection from the kernel functions. For this reason, when creating the model, it should be selected using multiple kernel functions to give the best performance among them. In this study, EEG data from Bonn University and 9 different classification problems are discussed. EEG signals were analyzed in 5 different frequency bands and feature vectors were generated from the standard deviation values of each frequency band. The generalization capabilities of linear, polynomial, radial based and Pearson VII(PUK) kernel functions are compared. The effect of PUK kernel functions parameter values on success rates is also investigated. With the model proposed in the study, processing load was reduced, dimensionality reduction algorithms were eliminated, and less processing load was created. It was concluded that PUK kernel function has better generalization performance than other functions. 100% success rate was achieved in two-class problems.",

        "abstract": "The most important issue encountered in reinforced concrete structures is the brittle of rebar. Structural elements with brittle behavior undergo rapid plastic deformation under loads. Since the energy absorbed by the brittle element is low, collapse occurs as soon as the structural element reaches its carrying capacity. It is therefore desirable that the structural elements have a certain ductile behavior. The various fibers added to the concrete can absorb more energy than the energy absorbed by this brittle behavior of concrete by providing some ductility to the concrete. The various fibers added to the concrete prevent the brittle fracture of the concrete by increasing ductility to the concrete. In this study, the effects of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) on hardened mortar properties of different volume fractions were investigated. The fibers were added to the mortar in a ratio of 2%, 4%, 6% by volume, and fiber-free control sample was produced. Compressive and flexural strength, ultrasound velocity, water absorption, dynamic elasticity modulus and microstructure analysis were performed and compared. According to the results, with the increase of PVA fiber utilization rate in mortars, multiple cracking behavior was observed in the produced samples and the mortars exhibited a ductile behavior and the crack widths decreased.",

On the other hand, using rework stations for this purpose only might cause inefficient usage of the resources in this station especially if the defective rate of the assembly line is low. In this study, first, a mixed-integer programming model for cycle time minimization is presented by considering the use of rework stations for parallel tasks. By linearizing the non-linear constraint about parallel tasks using a variate transformation, the model is transformed to a linear-mixed-integer form. Secondly, a novel simulation model is developed in the study for validating the results obtained using the integer programming model by incorporating stochastic problem components. Using the developed model, two sample problems are simulated and the applicability of the integer programming models results are analyzed.",

Hexagonal boron nitride and silica were mixed into the base fluid by 1% when obtaining the nanofluids. Although nanofluids have been located in the center of many thermal and thermodynamic analyses, the scientific research about the energy losses caused by their increased viscosity compared to the base fluids have remained insufficient. This study investigates the pressure losses of several nanofluids and their behaviors in a pipe. It was found out that the highest increment in pressure drop was in SiO2-DCM which has the largest viscosity of 0.00056 kg/ms and the smallest increment in pressure drop is in DCM which has the lowest viscosity with 0.000413 kg/ms for a constant pipe diameter.",

Diagnosis of the disease, its follow-up and measurements of the related brain regions can be performed with high-resolution three-dimensional structural magnetic resonance images. In this study, an atlas-based volume measurement and classification model were designed that can perform volumetric measurement of 116 subcortical regions on 70 Alzheimer 70 Normal 3D T1-weighted MR images taken from the OASIS database. The measured volume values were normalized by dividing gray matter, parenchyma, and total brain volume in each subject. Thus, 4 different datasets with 140x116 matrix size, including raw measured values, were obtained. Datasets were ranked from the most meaningful feature to the most meaningless feature with entropy, t-test, roc, Bhattacharyya, Wilcoxon feature ranking methods. The ranked data were combined in each cycle, respectively, and the classification process was performed by giving linear and rbf kernel support vector machines with 10-fold cross validations. Data cluster, feature ranking method and classification method that give the best results with the least feature were determined by analyzing all scenario. The effect of normalization and feature ranking methods on the classification results were examined. As a result of experimental operations, the roc feature ranking based linear support vector machine gives the highest rates with 95.71% sensitivity, 94.29% specificity, 95.00% accuracy, 0.95 area under curve values using 107 features with total brain volume normalization",

The influence of the binder types on the unit weight, ultrasonic pulse velocity, flexural and compressive strength ofthe manufactured SIFCON composites are investigated. The type of binder has changed up to 40% in the mechanical properties ofSIFCON. SIFCON produced with waste steel fibers reached a compressive strength of 41.1 MPa and a flexural strength of 25.3MPa.

The main variable in this research was the concrete type of the layers throughout the height of the specimen. The height of the cross-section of the beams was divided into 5 layers, each having 50 mm thicknesses. In group “F” specimens, SFRC layers were added to the layers of a CC beam, starting from the bottom, as replacements of CC layers, i.e. F15P10 represented that the bottom 150 mm was cast using SFRC whereas the top 100 mm was cast using CC. In group “P” specimens, CC layers were added to the layers of a SFRC beam, starting from the bottom, as replacements of SFRC layers, i.e. P10F15 represented that the bottom 100 mm was cast using CC whereas the top 150 mm was cast using SFRC. Experimental load-deflection curves were evaluated based on ultimate load, service/post-peak stiffnesses, and flexural toughness. It can be concluded that reasonable ductility may be achieved by adding SFRC at the tension side no matter how thick the layer is and where it is located.",

In scope of experimental study, the sand was placed in layers in a tank with two different relative densities (%30-%70) and vertical stress increments were measured by pressure gauges placed at the three different depths (z/B=1, z/B=2, z/B=3). In addition, vertical stress distribution in soil was computed with analytical methods based on elasticity theory (Boussinesq, Westergaard) and the Boston Rule (Approximate Method). As the findings obtained from the small scale model tests were examined, it was understood that relative density is a very effective parameter on stress distribution in granular soils. Also, it can be seen that the methods based on Elasticity theory may be insufficient to predict the stress increase in granular soils.",

Plugs that are produced by FDM, were polished using 800, 1000, 1200, 1600 and 2000 grit sandpapers to reduce friction. Also, thermal effects such as temperature distribution on the region where the plug touches the plastic sheet, were investigated. It has been found that FDM can be a significant alternative for male mould production in thermoforming. Additionally, PLA filaments have great potential for tool production in thermoforming.",

Friction between the sliding rigid punch and the surface of the half-plane leads to a frictional heat which directly flows towards the half-plane material without a loss, and it changes the material’s thermoelastic properties. Calculation of subsurface stresses is crucial in the aspect of mechanical design of components since most of failures arise from fatigue and fracture at regions where subsurface stresses reach higher levels. In order to solve the problem, an iterative algorithm is developed based on the finite element method. Steady state subsurface contact stresses are obtained once the frictional heat on the contact surface reaches equilibrium. Subsurface stresses are calculated for different values of punch sliding velocity and coefficient of friction. It is observed that difference between subsurface contact stresses calculated based on temperature dependent and temperature independent properties is remarkable. Higher values of punch velocity and coefficient of friction leads to greater amount of heat generation, and percent difference between stresses reaches significant level especially near the contact surface. The utilization of temperature dependent material properties provides better approximation in assessing fatigue and fracture behavior of machine parts subjected to frictional contact with heat generation.",

In the solutions, Standard k-ɛ, RNG k-ɛ, Realizable k-ɛ and Standard k-ω turbulence models were used comparatively and the performances of turbulence models were investigated for flow around two angularly positioned building models. The performances of turbulence models were examined and when compared with experimental data, it is seen that the results obtained by using the Standard k-ɛ turbulence model has more compatible with the experimental data. For different building angles, the velocity and pressure distributions in the entire flow fields were examined at the Reynolds number 7,7x105 in detail. In the diverging passages, the K values obtained along the center line of the passage between the buildings were obtained much greater than the K values in the converging passages. When the effect of angular change on the pressure coefficient distributions on the surface of building models is examined for the 8 different building configurations where the angle between buildings varies between 0° -180°, it has been seen that the most critical negative pressure coefficient values are affected by the change in angle between the buildings in the diverging and converging building configurations.",

In addition, since the overheating of the PV systems is prevented by the heat drawn by the thermal system, the electricity production performance of the PVs increases. Nanofluids are offered as a solution to increase the heat absorbed in the thermal system. The main physical events that lead to a significant improvement in the heat transfer performance of nanofluids can be summarized as follows: (i) The thermal conductivity of the prepared nanofluid increases at certain rates because the thermal conductivity of the solid metal is higher than that of the basic fluid, (ii) The heat transfer surface area increases due to the increase in the thermal conductivity of the fluid, (iii) Increase in the effective thermal capacity of the fluid, (iv) Increase in the thermal conductivity of the fluid and turbulent volume due to high fluid activity. In this study, by using nanofluids obtained by adding 1% Fe2O3, Fe3O4 and NiFe2O4 magnetic nanoparticles by weight to the basic fluid water, a bidirectional performance increase was achieved by increasing the thermal heat transfer of the PV/T system while providing more cooling of the PV system. In the experimental study, a 14% improvement in electricity production was achieved in NiFe2O4 nanofluid by drawing more heat from the heated PV panels by utilizing the high thermal conductivity of nanofluids. Since the amount of heat absorbed in the thermal system is high, an average of 104% temperature (∆T) increase in the hot fluid temperature compared to the base fluid water was obtained in the NiFe2O4 nanofluid.",

Increasing the concentration of oxygen by transferring oxygen from the atmosphere is named as aeration. Aeration can be performed with many hydraulic structures.  Two of the structures that have become widespread in the field of hydraulics are gated conduit and venturi. Venturi has throat part and air hole located into throat part. A difference of pressure, which provides aeration occurs between the venturi inlet and the throat part. A pressure difference occurs between up and down flows of the door in a partially opened gated conduit. Air entrains into flow from an air vent that were drilled downstream of the gate. A venturi was placed on air hole of a circular conduit that as called venturi-conduit, a new aeration system. The basic steps of the Artificial Bee Colony Programming (ABCP) developed for the solution of the symbolic regression problem come from the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC). In this study, ABCP is proposed to obtain functions that can model the ventilation performance of conduits with venture-conduit. The results of the method trained with experimentally measured data on 2 ventures with different contraction ratios were compared with artificial neural networks and genetic programming. ABCP outperformed genetic programming and neural networks on test data with an R2 value of 0.99 in both datasets. The RMSE values of 1.64 and 2.66, respectively, in the 2 data sets indicate that ABCP is capable of generating the appropriate function for the problem.",

The effect of tool runout on chip load is considered based on the true path of the flutes. An in-depth analysis indicates that tool runout shifts the cutting force pattern from the tooth passing frequency to the spindle rotational one.

        "abstract": "With the increasing population worldwide, the number of vehicles also increases. The increase in the number of vehicles brings with it many problems. The most important of these problems is traffic accidents. The situation where traffic accidents can cause material and moral losses reveals the necessity of working in this field. Classification is needed for better analysis and easy interpretation of traffic accidents. In this context, various classification methods and computer programs are developed with the development of technology and the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies into human life. In this study; the years are classified according to death and injury situations by using traffic accident data occurring year by year in our country. Then, with the WEKA analysis program, multilayer perceptron, regression and classification performances and error criteria of the nearest neighbor methods were calculated. When the classification values of all three algorithms are compared with each other, it has been found that the nearest neighbor algorithm gives better results in many criteria in terms of both performance analysis and error criteria. Thanks to this study, it has been determined that the rate of death and injury in traffic accidents that have occurred in recent years has reached a high risk level again as it was in the early 2000s. This situation is important for decision makers to increase their measures to reduce traffic accidents. On the other hand, by examining the classification performances, it was revealed which algorithm can be preferred in the classification process of the data set with similar characteristics.",

Due to the high frequency switching, thermal management is the main problem that has a significant effect on the reliability of the driver. Different applications are being studied to solve such overheating problems. In this study, the designed thermoelectric self-cooling system dissipates the excess heat generated in the push-pull drive circuit and improves system performance.  Thermoelectric self-cooling (TSC) is a new thermoelectric application which provide the cooling of any heat-generating device without electricity consumption. This paper presents the experimental analysis of a TSC system. An experimental setup is designed on a 275W push-pull ultrasonic driver circuit. In this study, it has been shown how the performance of the thermoelectric system changes with the use of cold extender of different thicknesses. 5 and 10 mm thickness cold extenders have had a positive effect on the cooling performance of both the hot and cold surfaces of the self-cooling system. However, when the thickness of the cold extender is increased beyond the threshold, the heat capacity of the cold extender has prevented the temperature between the cold and hot surfaces to reach critical temperature differences which enables the fan to operate.",

A research questionnaire was applied the managers of 99 enterprises, which were randomly selected with aim of this study. According to the research results; heating system of the enterprises were carried out with shavings heater (96%), which were found happy with the heating system. The rate of the rented enterprises was found more than the owned enterprises. There were no airing possibilities in most of the workshops. Owning the property of the enterprises increases the happiness of settling work placements. In spite of existing machine protectors in the workshops, self-protection for workers were used, however, the machine protectors were not commonly used by the workers. The machine protectors significantly decrease the accidents in accordance with the research results. As a result, inadequacy of workers for knowledge in use of physical placement and infrastructure of furniture enterprises was found. It is possible to say that there is a need of giving training to the workers about work security, productivity, and technological developments in work placements",

ICC (International Color Consortium) profiles which illustrate the colour spectra of devices used in the production process are one of the main components of the system. Manufacturers create their own profiles for their own device and printing systems. Since a certain amount of investment is required for the color management system, printing houses in Turkey prefer to use ready profiles instead of producing their own. However, since ready profiles contain general and average information they can from time to time give very different results. In this study, ready ICC profiles and profiles prepared by printing houses in Turkey have been compared. By measuring factors such as color values of the inks used, dot gain and white point, the average values obtained from the differences in color systems and the evaluation of color consistency lead to the identification of the differences between standard ICC profiles and ICC profiles produced in Turkey. In conclusion, incorrect profiles are not reliable since they only give approximate results. For a correct and high quality result profiles for each device and machine must be derived",

The high number of young people increases the demand for higher education and as a result of this demand, universities gain importance. Thus, the number of universities constituting the educational infrastructure of our country has increased rapidly in recent years. Therefore, it caused that increased the number of newly opened departments and quotas depending on the number of universities. In the face of rapid growth, public investment demands of universities to solve the infrastructure problem have also increased. Despite the establishment of new buildings and classrooms built in the campuses created to fill the quotas, 71 thousand quotas remained empty in 2019.  Thus, public resources were used inefficiently due to the fact that the envisaged public investments could not be utilized to the maximum. In this study, the places of the 125 state universities in Turkey were analyzed whether used efficiently. The number of buildings, the number of campuses, and the size of the indoor space they used were taken into consideration for this purpose. In addition, universities were grouped and evaluated according to the provinces where they were located and the years they were founded. While there was no significant difference between the groups according to CCR scores, it was concluded that there was a significant difference between the groups according to BCC scores. The test results show that there is a 5% significance difference between 32 universities established between 2006-2007 and 27 universities established until 1982 and 26 universities established between 1987-1994. The findings show that most of the universities allocated in 2018 use public resources efficiently.

This is especially due to its wide range of uses thanks to its numerous superior properties such as high electrical and thermal conductivity, high light transmittance, high strength and large surface area. Despite these superior properties, graphene's high sheet resistance and lack of energy band gap limit its use in optoelectronic applications. Yet, these disadvantages can be overcome by implementing doping to the graphene structure. However, although the doping selection and synthesis method are very important in the doped graphene synthesis process, the permanence and homogeneity of the doping is even more critical. In this study, the synthesis and characterization of pure and nitrogen-doped graphene were carried out on copper foil using CVD system. Pyridine was used for the synthesis of the doped graphene, as a carbon and nitrogen source. We found out that the use of the CVD technique allows both homogeneous and permanent doping. In addition to pyridine, in the present study, the film thickness was also optimized by providing a low amount of methane gas flow to the CVD system during the synthesis. To enable the characterization of doped films, Raman spectroscopy, Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photo electron spectroscopy techniques were used, and the film quality, thickness, homogeneity, doping rate and type were determined.",

The usage of these systems, which convert the solar energy into electrical energy, is rapidly widespreading. This intense interest aimed at photovoltaic panels brings with it studies of research and development on these systems. The great majority of the studies done is oriented to increase the efficiency of solar panels. The efficiency of photovoltaic panel is affected by factors such as surface pollution, location of the panel relative to the sun, shading and the type and temperature of solar panel cells. Increasing the temperature of solar cells reduces the electricity production of the panel. For this reason, solar panels need to be cooled for a higher efficiency and many methods have been developed for this purpose. In this study, efficiency of photovoltaic panels, which are air-cooled and with finned arrays of different geometries are applied to the bottom surface, are theoretically investigated. Within this scope, temperature distribution in the fins were obtained for three different fin types and these equations were solved analytically and numerically. Based on the results obtained, these fin types were compared in terms of parameters such as total heat transfer rate, fin efficiency, fin effectiveness, and total surface efficiency and the most appropriate fin type was tried to be determined. In summary, in this study, the amount of cooling obtained and the contribution of this cooling to the average temperature of the solar panel cells are theoretically analyzed. In the study, it has been determined that the average cell temperatures of the photovoltaic (PV) panel with fins placed on the bottom surface are 8 C to 26 C lower than the PV panel without fins, depending on parameters such as air velocity, fin spacing, and fin type. This decrease in cell average temperatures will result in an increase in electrical efficiency of about 6% to 11.5%, according to experimental data in the literature. Also in the study, it has been determined that rectangular fins provide 4.1% to 6.7% more heat transfer than triangular fins and 13.2% to 15.3% more than parabolic fins.",

In order to increase the mechanical properties of the fly ash added cement mortar, 1%, 2% and 3% Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) fiber was added to the mixture and the free shrinkage, flexural strength and compressive strengths of these mortar samples were examined. As a result of the experiments; It has been observed that as the UK substitution rates increase, the spread diameter increases, whereas in the mixtures with UK, the spread diameter decreases as the PVA rate increases. It was observed that the compressive strength decreases as the UK substitute increases in the mixtures, but when the PVA fiber is added in the mixtures with PVA fiber (UK15 coded mixture), the compressive strength increases by approximately 12%. However, it has been observed that as the addition of PVA fiber increases in UK substituted blends, the bending strength increases and the highest bending strength is in the mixture with 10% fly ash (UK10) substituted with 3% PVA fiber.

Electrical power systems need to communication networks and measurement systems for keeping the voltage and frequency stability. However, the utilizing of communication networks and measurement systems causes inevitable time delays which deteriorate the system dynamical behavior. In the study, a simple method finding delay margin values and critical eigenvalues considering state-space equations of the excitation control system are used. Also, the stability regions using the obtained delay margin values are determined. For the stability analysis, a single-machine-infinite-bus (SMIB) system including AVR and PSS is assigned as a test system. The accuracy of the delay-dependent stability regions are verified by time-domain simulations and the quasi-polynomial mapping-based root finder (QPmR) algorithm which demonstrates the dominant roots of time-delayed systems in complex plane, respectively.",

Because of these features, leaf springs are most used suspension element for the heavy vehicles. For this purpose, parametric rectangular cross sectional leaf spring design was obtained. For leaf spring design, FEA models of different variations were created and analyzed primarily between 1-10 layers using ANSYS software. The leaf spring layers and their dimensions were taken in varying ways according to the manufacturer's catalog. The effect of the number of leaf spring layers on element resistance and deformation was also simulated by changes in stresses. The number of layers between 1-10 and spring models of different section sizes were modeled parametrically in the ANSYS program and different variations were created by applying different load sizes. Mesh optimization of the model was performed in ANSYS software and all variations were solved. An Artificial Neural Networks Model was developed using stress-strain values depending on the design type and loading conditions obtained. Thus, depending on the number of layers, section measurement sizes and loading sizes, the spring constant (K), stress-strain values were estimated with high precision. Using the ANN model developed, the designer has put in place an approach that can be achieved quickly, easily and at a minimized design costs.",

It is to be said that each topology has its own benefits and drawbacks, meaning that each one may be the best option depending on the initial conditions of an implementation.

For this purpose, firstly, modified bitumens were obtained by adding 5, 10, 15 and 20% by weight of pirina to pure B 160/220 bitumen. Physical properties of pure and modified bitumens are determined by penetration, softening point and ductility tests; fluidity and workability properties at high temperatures by the rotational viscometer (RV) test; the permanent deformation resistance of the binders by dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) test; their chemical characterizations were determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. According to the physical and RV test results, it was observed that the binders tended to harden, their viscosity decreased and the workability temperatures increased accordingly. In addition, it has been determined that the temperature sensitivity of the binders decreases with the addition of pirina. According to DSR test results, the resistance of pure bitumen against permanent deformations at 58 oC high temperature increased to 64oC, especially by 15% due to the increase in the additive of pirina. According to the chemical characterization results, it was observed that the bitumen-pirina blend formed a homogeneous single-phase structure and the blend became an elastic structure despite hardening due to the cellulosic structure of the raw pirina. As a result, it was observed that the workability of the binders hardened with the pirina additive, but their resistance to permanent deformation at high temperatures increased.",

Traditionally, such data are collected via loop detectors, inductive loops, video cameras, but their installation cost were not always allowed to locate every specific point. Recently, Bluetooth (BT) technology has been widely used as a traffic data source due to the i) low installation cost, and ii) providing continuous data even 24-h period. The principle of BT-based traffic data is simply capturing the timestamped of the unique Media Access Control (MAC) of Bluetooth devices. Detecting the same MAC addresses from multiple different locations enabled to estimate the Origin and Destination (O-D) of the trips and travel time information. This study evaluates the distribution of TT information from different perspectives in which BT-based traffic data were obtained from five consecutive signalized intersections located in Mersin, Turkey during morning peak hours of 07:30-09:30 for the two weekdays. The results indicated that the data had considerable success in estimating travel times and urban traffic monitoring with adequate sampling rates. However, the filtering process must be carefully handled to distinguish the motorized movements from non-motorized ones.",

One of the main problems of the use of hip prostheses is not transferred the bodyweight regularly through the prostheses. In this study, a new hip prosthesis design is developed to transfer the body weight to lower extremity without damaging. Both femur and prostheses were modeled using a 3D solid modeling technique and were mounted to each other. The prepared femur-prostheses pairs were transferred into ANSYS Workbench software to simulate using the Finite Element based technique and subjected to the body weight and muscle forces to calculate stresses and strains. The von Mises stresses on the prostheses were examined to evaluate the prosthesis strength. The maximum axial strain values were obtained and evaluated to determine the stress shielding. Based on the results, the new design prosthesis has the risk of lower stress shielding and lower risk of failure. Therefore, the new hip prosthesis design may be used to eliminate the disadvantages in the traditional hip prostheses.",

It is known that they are heavier and more durable than other structures for their construction purposes. Historical structures such as mosques, churches and bridges, expressed in a form, have structural elements such as columns, beams, vaults, domes, arches. Generally, it is easier to comment on the structural behavior of these types of structures with structural behavior theories. However, when interpreting about the structural behaviors of buildings with heavy mass, such as castle, not having a specific, regular form, it is necessary to proceed systematically in line with the basic principles of engineering. The purpose of this article is the systematic interpretation of the structural balance of the castle-type heavy mass structures under environmental effects by finite element calculation method. Three basic form in finite element modeling, rectangular, hexagonal and circular geometry samples of tower,  are modeled in SAP 2000 finite element package program. The effect of time-dependent material loss of these three forms on the structure was analyzed by gradual linear static analysis.",

Besides, this problem has been used as a benchmark for developing new Artificial Intelligence search techniques. However, it is known that backtracking algorithms, one of the most frequently used algorithms to solve this problem, cannot produce all solutions in large n values due to the exponentially growing time complexity. Therefore, various methods have been proposed for producing one or more solutions, not all solutions for each n value. In this study, a pattern based approach that produces at least one unique solution for all n values (n>3) was detected. By using this pattern, a new algorithm that produces at least one unique solution for even very large n values in linear time was developed. The developed algorithm with О(n) time complexity produces quite faster solution to n-queens problem and even in some values, this algorithm produces (n-1)/2 unique solutions in linear time.",

As a result, it is very difficult to get the best solution, even high-quality solutions, at a reasonable time. For this reason, the evaluation of the criteria that are effective in the scheduling and planning process of the operating room has been discussed. In this study, the analytical network process method which is one of multi-criteria decision-making methods has been used. Because this method considers the interaction of the criteria with each other and their relationships and dependencies. There are 24 sub-criteria under the 7 main criteria related to surgeons, operating room schedules, operating room resources, equipment and consumables, operating room staff, patients and other factors. The network structure of these criteria is created with the analytical network process method. Then, the significance levels of the criteria have been calculated. From the results obtained, the criteria for surgeons among the main criteria is in the foreground. The results show that resources in operating rooms should be used effectively. Therefore, it is necessary to pay attention to use resources effectively in the operating room scheduling processes.",

The chip shapes vary with the tool-rake angle. During the serrated chip formation, the primary deformation region exhibits substantially higher stress than secondary region. Also, the higher strains are occurred at the chip roots. The fluctuation of the cutting force caused by the serrated chip is more prominent than that obtained during the continuous chip formation, and the force varies periodically. The results also show that an increase in the positive direction of rake angle causes a decrease in cutting force and a smoother workpiece surface.",

In the economic examination of the applicability of monorail in developing countries; by using the travel and cost data of Eskisehir-Turkey, economic and financial feasibility studies on two separate lines were made. According to the results of Eskişehir, for the countries which have 10% discount rate including Turkey, an increase in the number of daily passengers to 55 thousand or a decrease in construction costs to 15 million $/km could be sufficient in the economic analysis. Also, with current data, a discount rate of about 8% could be sufficient to be feasible. For financial analysis, the majority of costs could not be covered at a 10% discount rate and financial state support could be required.

Fractured surface SEM investigations showed that the reinforcement elements were homogeneously dispersed in the UHMWPE matrix. The presence of reinforcement elements has been proven by SEM-EDS and XRD analysis. It was observed that the hardness values of the composites increased from 40 MPa to 66.6 MPa with the addition of reinforcement elements.

However, the experimental studies reveal that the temperature rise occurring under cyclic loads in the lead core, causes a deterioration in the characteristic strength by decreasing the yield strength of the lead, and it is important to consider this effect. In seismically isolated buildings, in addition to the isolation system, the superstructure also has a degree of energy dissipation capacity thanks to its inherent damping. It is seen that different damping ratios are used in the designs of such structures and research studies dealing with these structures. In this study, the change in the temperature-dependent behavior of seismically isolated buildings is investigated in cases where (i) superstructure damping is taken as 5% similar to fixed base reinforced concrete buildings, (ii) superstructure damping is taken as a smaller value such as 2%, and (iii) superstructure damping is completely neglected. A seismically isolated reinforced concrete building is modeled in the OpenSees program, considering the effect of the lead core heating on the characteristic strength and responses such as floor accelerations, temperature increase in the lead core, bearing shear forces and displacements obtained from nonlinear time history analyses are investigated. The results obtained showed that especially the floor accelerations can vary significantly and the floor accelerations obtained with different superstructure damping ratios can be in different limit ranges.",

This has increased the demand for fiber reinforced composites. Composite materials, which used in different environments and loading conditions, must have several mechanical properties according to their use. One of the factors affecting these mechanical behaviors of the material is crack formation that occurs during production, assembly or usage. The deformation rate, crack length and crack geometry directly affect the fracture behavior of the laminated composites. In this study, the fracture behaviors of S-2 glass/epoxy laminated composites having cracks in different lengths and geometries were investigated at different deformation rates experimentally and numerically. Within the scope of the study, the Mode I (opening mode) and Mode I/II (mixed mode) fracture behaviors of the samples with 5mm, 10mm and 15mm crack length and 0º and 45º crack geometry were investigated at different deformation rates. Fracture tests were carried out in three different deformation rates, such as 8.3×10-3, 8.3×10-4 and 8.3×10-5 s-1 to express the relationship between crack onset and deformation rate. Also, the fracture behavior of S-2 glass/epoxy laminated composites was analyzed by using the Finite Element Method (FEM).  It was found that the results obtained were compatible with each other. Experiments and FEM results show that the fracture behavior of S-2 glass/epoxy composite material is sensitive to environmental temperature and strain rate in both Mode I and Mode I/II crack tip opening conditions and varies according to the investigated test parameters.",

Although numerous experimental and laboratory works have been developed to study the mechanisms that govern different types of pavements, there are few works where they are explicitly determined. That is why the main novelty of this work consists in presenting analytical methods capable of quantifying the performance of the pavement based on the materials that compose it and the traffic loads to which it is subjected.

When damage occurs in asphalt concrete, bitumen can flow into cracks with heat and provide recovering by filling the cracks. Much of the current literature on self-healing pays particular attention to artificially heat asphalt concrete by several methods, including microwave heating. Although there is a growing body of literature that recognizes using steel fibers in microwave healing asphalt, there are no data on the use of aluminum fibers to improve microwave healing. This paper evaluates the microwave healing potential of asphalt concrete that contains metal wastes such as aluminum and steel shavings. Besides, the use of basalt and limestone aggregate (BA and LA) in asphalt concrete were evaluated. To achieve this, firstly, microwave absorption capabilities of BA and LA were determined. In the second step of the study, porous asphalt concrete specimens were prepared, and they were damaged by the indirect tensile (IDT) strength test at low temperatures. After that, damaged specimens were healed via microwave heating, and they were damaged again by the IDT strength test. In the end, the healing index of the specimens was determined as the proportion of healed specimen’s strength to the original. It has been found that BA is almost three times more microwave absorber material than LA, and asphalt specimens containing BA showed better healing performance. It has also been demonstrated for the first time that aluminum shavings might be a better option than steel shavings to accelerate microwave healing.",

Although traditional crypto systems are used in text encryption, it has been found that image encryption is not preferred due to high correlation and the amount of data. After giving general information about cryptology, some current image encryption algorithms and the properties of these algorithms have been mentioned. The traditional crypto systems such as Caesar, Affine, Vigenere and Substitution methods have been applied separately to pixel color values and pixel positions on the image, and encryption performance has been studied.

Lifecyle, efficiency and safety of battery packs can be increased by balancing systems. Battery balancing systems are divided into two group as passive and active. In passive balancing systems the amount of charge causing imbalance between cells is discharged by a resistor while in active balancing sytems imbalance between the cells is eliminated by transferring energy from high state of charge cell to low one. Increasing number of cells is led to complexity of balancing systems. Converter based balancing systems present a feasible solution to battery packs with a large number of cells. In this study, a bidirectional flyback converter in order to use in battery active balancing systems has been developed. Simulation and test results revealed that the developed bidirectional flyback converter is suitable for battery active balancing systems. The highest efficiencies were obtained as 67.84% at 32.5% duty cycle at charge test and 66.02% at 50% duty cycle at discharge test.",

When the concept of Publish/subscribe (Pub/Sub) systems were used as a communication tool in a P2P network, the network required additional optimization algorithms to reduce the complexity. The major difficulty for such networks was creating an overlay design algorithm (ODA) to define the communication patterns. Although some ODAs may perform worse on a high-scale, some may have better average/maximum node degrees. Based on the experimentation and previous works, this study designed an algorithm called the Hypercube-ODA, which reduces the average/maximum node degree for a topic connected Pub/Sub network. The Hypercube-ODA algorithm creates the overlay network by creating random cubes within the network and arranging the nodes with the cubes they belong to. In this paper, the details of the proposed Hypercube algorithm were presented and its performance was compared with the existing ODAs. Results from the experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms other ODA methods in terms of lower average node degree (lowering the average node degree by up to 60%).",

According to the relationship of the contractile force in the muscles, the porpuse was to increase muscle growth by gaining more contractile force. Previous studies had generally examined muscle behavior under maximum force. However, the relationship between increased dumbbell weight and muscle contraction was not fully investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanical behaviors resulting from the application of dynamic forces that occur during the dumbbell curl exercise on muscle fibers. In this study, biceps brachii muscle force during biceps curl exercise performed with two different weights (5kg and 10kg) was calculated. Then, a finite element model was developed and mechanical behaviors in the biceps muscle fiber during exercise were investigated. It was achieved that there was no linear correlation between dumbbell weight and muscle force. It was observed that when dumbbell weights were doubled (100%), the maximum muscle force and deformation increased by 83.13% and 84.92%, respectively. The results showed that increasing excessive weight during exercises will not be as beneficial for muscle development as expected.",

Detecting and destroying these mines without harming people is an important issue. Today, these landmines are detected using different methods such as Ground Effect Radar, Electromagnetic induction, Infrared and Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance and active sensors are generally used in most of these methods. Although active sensor-based landmine detectors are often used for performance reasons, they can cause unintentional landmine explosions because they operate with transmitted and reflected signals. On the other hand, there is no such obstacle that can perform better in passive sensor-based landmine detectors depending on the design criteria. Therefore, in this study, a prototype design including passive sensor with magnetic anomaly method has been developed and shown. For the performance analysis of this detector, real landmines are used and the designed system is tested with different distance values in different soil types. The results show that the prototype produced successfully detects different types of landmines, is assertive in its lightness and only 1750 grams with its battery, providing sensitivity as well as advantages such as ease of use and low cost. It also shows the feature of being the first handheld landmine detector based on magnetic anomaly.",

In the designs, CPAC (P: Active prismatic joint) leg structure provided with D4 type constraint and CPAC (A: Active rotational joint) leg structure provided with A1 type constraint were used. In addition, the CPAC (A: Active rotational joint, P: Active prismatic joint) leg structure obtained by using two active joints in a single leg was also used in the designs. This robot type is also referred to as a 3-CCC mechanism in the literature. In the first design proposal, the fixed and mobile platforms were determined to be equilateral triangles with cylindrical joints. Platforms are connected to each other by 3 CCC leg types. In the second design proposal, the movable platform with fixed cylindrical joints placed in XY, XZ and YZ planes and pointwise end-effector is connected with 3 CCC leg types. The lengths of the cylindrical joints used in the fixed and mobile platform were kept the same in both designs. While calculating the working spaces, the limit points that the end functionalist can reach were determined and the inside area was scanned at 5 mm intervals and its accessibility was checked. Working spaces are calculated by first holding the mobile platform fixed at 0o and then rotating it between -30o + 30o angles. With the results obtained, it has been seen that the working space can be expanded with different designs.",

The elastosonography technic demonstrated a colour map over B mode image. Different colours extended from green (soft) to ruddy (hard) to illustrate tissue feature after compression-decompression periods. In kids, spermatic cord with testicular torsion is among the main significant events. Differentiation from other acute scrotal events is confusing in diagnosis and therapy. The point of experimental research is to determine the viability of elastosonography, which investigates stiffness as a target strategy in determination and intervention of spermatic cord torsion. 16 male rabbits of a similar weight and age were chosen. They were separated into 2 groups including 8 rabbits. In Group 1, right testis was constant; in Group 2, the same testis experienced 720° curve a clockwise way and stabilized. After 1-2 hours of ischemic period, elastosonography estimations were applied. Nonetheless, the left spermatic cord was estimated again at 24 hours to notice the possible progressions; because ischemia may also have an effect to the left spermatic cord. B mode US and elastosonography procedures were applied with a linear probe. Statistically increment was recognized in elastosonography estimations of right spermatic cord at 1-2-24 hours (p<0.05). There were no significant changes between the groups of left spermatic cord at 1-2 hours. Elastosonography values were significant in left spermatic cord at 24 hours (p<0.05). The elastosonography estimations of the spermatic cord torsion appeared evidently with the expansion in span of ischemia. It was seen that the elastosonography strategy may have a part with other indicative procedures in diagnosis of cord torsion.",

Experiments were performed with normal valves installed on the radiators, then the existing valves were replaced with thermostatic valves and the experiments were repeated. Thanks to the TRVs, the temperature of each room could be kept constant at the set value and it was observed that a comfortable heating was provided. The use of TRV homogenized the temperature distributions on the radiators and provided natural gas savings by preventing unnecessary heating of the radiator. According to the results obtained, it has been calculated that natural gas consumption can be reduced by 1.4 m3 per day thanks to TRV. This value means a natural gas saving of 41.82 m3 per month and 250.9 m3 with a 6-month usage per year. Considering the current natural gas prices, there is an annual saving of 577.1 ₺. A total of 7 thermostatic valves with a unit price of 150 ₺ were installed in the flat and the payback period was calculated as 1.67 years.

        "abstract": "Today, noise is becoming a problem depending on the developing technology. Noise is called disturbing sound. Controlling the noise depends on raising the quality of life to higher levels. Although the intensity of the noise is not at a level that will affect human health, it should be reduced or eliminated. Due to the effect of the noise level on the health of the person; requires serious consideration of the issue. Sound absorption coefficients of the materials used in the interior play an important role in providing sensory comfort depending on the volume. Natural and artificial wood materials are used in interior design, especially in the construction of partition elements. Wood material is natural and has some important usage advantages as well as different disadvantages. In the study carried out to determine the sound absorption coefficients of wood-based composite materials used indoors, chipboard and fiberboard samples were used and covered with oak and beech veneers, and then their surfaces were coated with single and double component water-based, which does not contain solvent-based resin. The sound absorption coefficients of the obtained samples were determined by the impedance tube method and the results were compared statistically. It has been determined that the results can be evaluated within the frequency values, besides, different results are obtained according to the properties of wood-based composite boards, coating and water-based varnish types.  According to the results of the study, it may be preferable to use oak veneer on the raw material surfaces of wood material-based composite material types and to cover their surfaces with a double component varnish. In addition, synthetic resin-coated particle board (chip) which is one of the ready-made boards can be recommended to be used primarily.",

Colourful samples obtained after preconcentration were placed in a digital imaging box and colorimetric analysis was performed using an application that can be downloaded to smartphones. Before starting the analyzes, optimization studies were carried out for the distance of the quartz cuvette placed in the digital imaging box to the lens, the location of the point where the colorimetric determination will be made on the quartz cuvette, and the radius of the point to be analyzed. As a result of the analysis of antimony samples with different concentrations under optimum conditions, a linear region in the range of 1-4 mg/L was obtained and the limit of detection (LOD) for antimony was calculated as 0.71 mg/L. In the study, the percent relative standard deviation for the lowest concentration was 0.33% (n=8). This value indicates that the analysis has high sensitivity.",

Using agricultural wastes, which are renewable natural fibers on an annual basis, as raw materials in composite production also means that waste materials are kept in the material cycle. When considered as a raw material, mushroom is also a renewable resource and it takes part in material production since mycelium acts as an adhesive with its enzymes between natural fibers. Due to being completely organic, composite materials made of mushroom and natural fibers can be fully degraded in nature at the end of their product life cycle. In this study, a composite material has been developed by using wheat straw as the substrate and mycelium of Pleurotus ostreatus as the binder while the production method is an organic growth process. In flammability tests, it was measured that the ignition started at the 67th second. After immersion in water for 24 hours, it is determined that the water absorption value of the material is 257% and thickness expansion is between 2.55-3.63%.",

Thermal effusivity is a thermophysical property of the materials that depends on the thermal conductivity value (λ, W/mK), specific heat (c, J/kgK) and density (ρ, kg/m3). Thermal athalet gives information about the thermal behaviour of the material at different heat conditions. While the surface temperature of a low thermal inertia material changes very rapidly under the effect of a temperature changing environment, the surface temperature of a high thermal inertia material changes more slowly. In this study, the thermal properties of an existing building facades were investigated by quantitative infrared thermography method. The west (ÇA1) and north (ÇA2) facades of the building have been chosen as the study area. The study was conducted between 07:00 am and 19:30 pm, on a sunny day in July. Thermal images were taken per hour of study areas coded as CA1 and CA2; thermal maps of the study areas were created with this thermal images. The thermal parameters such as temperature difference (ΔT), rate of warming up (RW) and ratio of the rate of warming up between the defect area and sound area (RWDEFECT / RWSOUND) were obtained with the surface temperature on thermal maps. The thermal properties of the materials using in building facades were examined by these thermal parameters In addition, the thermal defects areas in the study regions were determined and these defects areas were evaluated with quantitative data. The result of the study has shown that materials with high thermal inertia have lower rate of warming up data.

WE series is a series of Mg alloys containing Mg, Y, Nd, rare earth elements, and although the creep strength is good for this alloy series, the wear resistance is open to improvement. The aim of this study is to develop coatings that can increase the wear resistance of WE43 Mg alloys, which have a high potential for use due to their specific gravity, by using a method that can be easily applied in the industry. For this purpose, using the cold spray coating method, magnesium alloys, whose surfaces are highly active, are provided to be coated without oxidation and wear resistance is improved. In the study carried out, WE43 Mg alloys, which roughen the surfaces by fine sandblasting process, were used with cold spray method, using powders containing Al/Zn/Al2O3 and Zn/Al2O3 and trade names DYMET K-20-11 and DYMET K-00-11, respectively, using N2 shielding gas at 500ºC. 6 g/min for powders delivered to supersonic speeds under the atmosphere. The powder was sprayed onto the substrates using the feed rate. Morphological analysis of the coated and uncoated samples with different contents were examined by SEM, XRD methods, the coating thicknesses were measured with SEM images taken from the section, and the percentages of the elements were determined by EDS analysis. In addition, ball-on disc wear tests were performed to examine the wear performance and volume losses were evaluated. As a result, the wear loss of WE43 alloys was reduced by approximately 40% compared to the uncoated condition, thanks to the cold spray coatings.",

        "abstract": "Increasing in the number of floors in building design against earthquake, it becomes necessary to use reinforced concrete shear walls in order not to exceed the bearing capacity of elements and the limit of horizontal displacements and to prevent damage of frame infill walls. When the structures exposed to earthquakes are examined, the shear wall elements are exposed to greater shear stresses as a result of the lack of enough reinforced concrete shear walls in some buildings and also horizontal displacements exceed the limit values and unexpected premise brittle shear failures occur in the shear walls. It is known that with the addition of partial shear walls to the reinforced concrete frame system, the frame system behavior has changed into a mixed system behavior and with the further increase of the shear wall ratio, it transforms into a shear wall behavior similar to cantilever beam.There are many studies on determination of the shear wall area required depending on only a single floor area to limit horizontal displacements. Herein, in order to let the building exhibit shear wall behavior, during the preliminary design stage of the columns and shear walls, the minimum value of the ratio of the shear wall area to the area of all floors has been tried to be determined taking into account the ratio of the moment taken by the shear walls to the building base moment, building cost increase depending on the increase in the quantity of the steel reinforcement and shear wall-frame behavior compatibility. For this purpose, a five-storey symmetrical building in plan was designed consisting of a frame system in accordance with the rules of the Turkish Building Earthquake Code (TBEC-2018). Firstly, elevator shear wall was added to the model consisting of the beam-column frame system, and then by adding symmetrical shear walls in various ratios to this model, a total of 10 models were created.",

The Reynolds number based on the velocity was between 1.65x107 to 6.5x107 according to the Mach (M) number between 0.7 to 2.8 in the present simulation. The drag coefficients from 0.7 M to 2.8 M were obtained separately for each Mach 0.3 increase. The Free Computer-Aided Design (FreeCAD) program was used for geometrical drawings of the ammunition, the Geometry Description, Meshing, Solving, and Post-Processing (GMSH) software for mesh operations, and the Shear Stress Transport (SST) turbulence model to create a compressible finite volume. As well, 0 degrees was used as the angle of attack. For estimation of the aerodynamic coefficient percentage changes obtained from the simulations, exponential equations with the highest validity based on the R2 value were created. In addition, the calculated drag coefficients were compared with the actual values and a good fit was observed between them.",

However, in the dynamic weighting systems, the measurement signal is noisy as the weighted product is in motion and various methods must be used to determine the weight of product within a definite period of time.

This situation is realized through coordination among the protective devices. The involvement of renewable energy generation resources to the energy transmission system complicates the network protection, thus undermining the security coordination or decreasing the protection coordination zone. In particular, such issues become even more vigorous in power networks with effect of renewable energy resource generations. Therefore, the conventional power protection methods are insufficient in such networks, requiring software strategies involving the renewable energy generation resources. For that purpose in this study, Petri net method is used for estimating the faulted section in power transmission network in the presence of renewable energy generation resources and designing of protection coordination schemes. The information about the status of protection elements acquired from the automation system was adopted as input to the Petri net method. Renewable energy resource generations effect can increase the risk of disharmony among protection systems. The accuracy of Petri net models are improved by phase angle shifts in the voltage waveforms of renewable energy generation resources and the main power supply using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) through which the Petri net model inputs was corrected.",

When sun is shining and a day without cloud, the more electric power can be produced with solar energy, but the amount of produced electrical energy is fluctuating continuously by depending on the climatic condition and solar irradiation. Energy storage applications can cope with the change in value resulting from the power of renewable energy systems according to climatic conditions and only day that can work as solar energy systems. The use of energy storage application is become compulsory solutions for providing more power quality to the loads by using micro grids. In this study, modelling of batteries that are component of energy storage system has been performed. In the laboratory, battery charge/discharge tests were implemented to obtain the necessary parameters for modelling studies. Graphics and results were obtained with MATLAB/M-File program by using experimental results. Experimental and modelling results compared and the accuracy of the modelling equations is given in this paper.",

The salt KCl was used at different mass percentages of 5, 10 and 15. The binodal and tie line data were determined by the cloud point method. The addition of the salt showed to be effective in altering the LLE of water/ ethanol/1- butanol system in favor of the solvent extraction of ethanol from the aqueous solution particularly at high salt concentrations. The experimental data were correlated considering the modified version of the NRTL model for the activity coefficient, with the estimation of new binary interaction parameters corresponding to salt-solvent and solvent-solvent pairs. The deviations between experimental and calculated compositions in both phases for the ternary system using these new interaction parameters showed the ability of NRTL to determine liquid-liquid equilibrium data of the studied systems in the presence of the salts.",

In this study, as a first step a 3d printer is constructed by modifying open source hardware and controlled by improving open source software. Subsequently, an ankle foot orthosis (AFO) is designed and constructed by using this 3d printer.The ankle foot orthosis, very important for human walking, is designed to control motion of the ankle and prevents deformities. An AFO can generally be used for following purposes: brace weak limbs, grasp ankle and foot in the right position and correct the foot drop. Since the users have different sizes of ankles and different types of deformities, an AFO must be produced to match in size to the end-user. Therefore off-the-shelf AFOs may not suitable for the each end user. Considering these factors, 3d printers are of great importance for producing individualized biomedical equipment. In this study, a distinctive ankle foot orthosis is first modelled by using CAD software and then produced by using constructed 3d printer. This AFO is the first ankle foot orthosis produced by a 3d printer in the literature of our country. This study is a proof that biomedical equipments can be produced in a shorter time and less costly by using 3d printers.",

The hardness increased with increasing mold rotation speed and hardness values of specimens produced in air atmosphere are higher than that of manufactured in vacuum atmosphere for all parts of specimens produced in high (7,38 – 14,23 – 21,56 °C/s) cooling rates. On the other hand, the specimens produced in low cooling rate (0,27 °C/s) have varying hardness values depending on the location of the cast part. Hardness increased with increasing mold rotation speed in the far part of specimens to the rotation axis. It remained unchanged in middle section and decreased with increasing mold rotation speed in parts close to the rotation axis. Also, hardness values of specimens obtained in air atmosphere are lower in far part, same in middle and higher in rotation axis by comparison with the specimens obtained in vacuum atmosphere.

The catalysts were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method with different iron contents (1 and 5 wt%) and characterized by XRD, SEM, FT-IR, nitrogen adsorption, UV-Vis DRS, and ICP-AES measurements. Among the prepared catalysts the 1 wt% iron containing the TiO2 catalyst showed better catalytic activity (with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) reduction of 65.4% at the end of 6h of oxidation) than the other catalysts. The effects of the parameters such as the initial BPA concentration, H2O2 amount, catalyst amount, the pH of the initial BPA solution, and reaction temperature were studied with that catalyst on the heterogeneous photo-Fenton-like oxidation of an aqueous BPA solution. The small amount of iron that leached to the solution and the reusability of the catalyst illustrates that the process is mainly the heterogeneous photo-Fenton-like process, instead of the homogeneous photo-Fenton-like process. The degradation of BPA was described by the first order kinetics with an activation energy of 22.5 kJ/Mol.",

In sample fabrication stage, first, the ohmic In contact has been performed on one surface of n-Ge wafer grown in direction of (100). Later, the other surface of the wafer has been coated with rubrene by spin-coating method and then the Schottky contact has been constituted on the organic material via thermal evaporation method. The current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of prepared Schottky diode has been measured at a temperature range of 150-300 K and it has been observed that the diode have a rather good rectification behavior at all temperature. By using the I-V characteristics, the idealite factor, barrier height and some other diode parameters have been calculated for all temperatures. These parameters have also been calculated by means of Cheung-Cheung method. Werner and Güttler’s model has been employed to analyze the temperature dependence of barrier height and ideality factor at low temperatures. The standard deviation of the zero-bias barrier height was calculated as 120 mV and the voltage coefficients of the barrier height were determined as 𝜌2 = 0.184 and 𝜌3 = 0.232 mV. At high temperatures, the zero-bias barrier height decreases with increasing temperature because of the temperature dependence of semiconductor band gap. The non-linearity has been observed in the Richardson plot due to temperature dependence of the zero-bias barrier height. Richardson constant was determined by using different methods. Of the current-voltage analysis’s has emerged an abnormal decrease of apparent barrier height and increase of ideality factor at low temperature. It is determined that these abnormalies result due to the barrier height inhomogeneities prevailing at the organic-semiconductor interface. As a result, homogeneities in Au/rubrene/n-Ge Schottky barrier diode can be successfully characterized by a Gaussian distribution.",

In this paper, analysis of the reinforced concrete columns jacketing method was experimentally investigated by acoustic emission technique. Non-load-bearing reinforced concrete columns with dimensions of 25x25x195 cm were reinforced with the jacketing method. With this regard, two different types of retrofitting strategies were applied to RC columns and were validated via the results of a reference column. The first column has impermanent vertical reinforcement and no anchors. Second column is designed as shear reinforcement (anchors), impermanent vertical reinforcement. As a differance from the second column in the third column vertical reinforcements are permanent. Then, the specimens under reversible cyclic loads have been subjected to failure. Result from this experimental work, the acoustic emission analysis of specimens are compared, commented and recommendations are made accordingly.",

These arches were loaded uniformly until failure is occured. Each arch’es load-deformation and total energy consumed-deformation graphs were drawn. According to test results although the arch constructed by using interlocking interface with mortar has the highest load carrying capacity, it was determined that the arch constructed using smooth interface with mortar has the highest performance because of its superior deformation energy consuming capacity with respect to other arches",

The effects of the equivalence ratio (φ) and the heat transfer rate (Q) to the combustion chamber on the combustion and entropy generation rate are investigated for the different φ’s (from 0,5 to 1.0) and Q’s (from 5 to 10 kW). The numerical calculation of the combustion is performed for all cases by using the Fluent CFD code. Furthermore, a computer program has been developed to numerically calculate the volumetric entropy generation rate distributions and the other thermodynamic parameters by using the results of the calculations performed with the FLUENT code. The maximum values of reaction rates decreased with the increase of φ. The calculations bring out that in the case of φ<1, the complete combustion occurs and that the combustion in the case of φ=1 is very close to the complete combustion state. Although the levels of the entropy generation rate profiles rise up with the increase of Q, they decrease exponentially with the increase of φ. It is obtained from the numerical results that the maximum entropies are generated in the case of φ=0,5 and that their values vary in the range of 3,7- 7,6 W/K depending onQ",

These devices which draw non-linear current from the grid by nature cause the nonlinear voltage drops along the supply line. In this case, if precautions are not taken, power quality problems also appear for the other loads fed from the same line. Level of the harmonic currents drawn can be reduced to specific level by using reactors with silicon steel core at the input of the line frequency converters. Selection of the core material with the sizing of the reactors becomes the determiner of the harmonic reducing ability and of the losses of the reactor. In this study, three reactors with different core materials are designed for a specific line current value. In order to see the inductance value variations depending on the load level of the designed reactors, the parametric analysis have been performed by the finite element method. As a result of analysis, data like the reactor inductance stability, the losses and the standards compliance have been presented comparatively. Magnetic circuits have been modeled with Ansys-Maxwell and co-simulated with the Simplorer to see the realistic behaviors of the reactors",

The geometric flexibility associated with the Monte Carlo method makes it very suitable for the generation of highly accurate multi-group constants. While the deterministic lattice codes are not capable of dealing with energy as a continuous variable the Monte Carlo codes such as MCNPX make use of a continuous energy cross sections data for neutron transport calculations. To determine the scattering matrix, an output file of a MCNPX run (socalled PTRAC file) with all relevant source, collision and terminal events of the simulation is used. First, by a separately special program in MATLAB, the PTRAC file is read and tracks are selected in the geometrical region for which one wants to calculate the multi-group constants. Then, information such as coordinates of the particle position, particle direction with coordinates axes, energy and weight of the particle are extracted. The multi-group scattering matrix elements are generated via the weight-to-flux ratio method using the above data available in the PTRAC file. The proposed method is validated using three benchmark problems involve a slab, a pin cell, and a fuel assembly of Tehran research reactor (TRR). The generated multi-group constants via presented method and multiplication factor calculation presents a good comparison to the reference values",

For this reason, several researches were undertaken a local manufacturing devices which can realize this objective. The focus of this article is to discuss a new approach of solar distillation system. The aim is to combine a double slope solar still with a cylindrical solar water heater which can be motivated by the two following significant reasons: firstly, to increase water temperature inside the solar still in order to improve with, high level, its distillate production capability, besides, the cylindrical type solar heater has a good ability of heating water with low heat losses to the ambient surrounding. Both of the previous systems may form a double slope active solar still. Performed numerical investigations are based on the determination of temperature and distillate mass profiles in the case of an active solar still and to compare them to those of solar still without preheating system. The computer program has been elaborated in this study using Fortran 6.6 language as an investigation platform to examine temperature and mass production parameters. Simultaneously, temperature increasing and mass production have been computed through the active solar still and compared to the uncoupled system (passive solar still). Results show clearly an increase of temperature and distillate mass production by 8.94 °C and 0.67 kg/m2/day respectively",

This study comprehensively evaluates machine learning models on traffic accident records sourced from the Addis Ababa City Police Department. Comprising 12,316 records with 15 features, the dataset underwent preprocessing techniques, specifically Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Min-Max scaling. Five algorithms – Random Forest (RF), Gaussian Naive Bayes, CatBoostClassifier, LightGBM, and XGBoost – were tested for their prediction accuracy. The findings spotlight the dominance of the RF model, achieving a peak accuracy of 92.2% post-SMOTE and Min-Max application. A comparative analysis with existing literature showed that while RF is a recurrently effective model across various datasets, data preprocessing and model suitability to specific datasets is paramount. This study underscores the potential of machine learning in traffic accident analysis and the nuanced choices researchers must make for optimal outcomes.",

In accordance with the architectural survey studies, the historical building was modelled in 3D in two different types according to shell and solid modelling techniques. According to the results of response spectrum analysis, stress and displacement distributions and modal characteristic parameters of the structure were evaluated.  When the analysis results of the models created with the solid model technique and the shell model technique are compared, it is concluded that the shell modelling technique is safe in such studies, considering the analysis time and modelling difficulty.

Therefore, the objective of this research is to assess the effectiveness of friction pendulum-type isolators, one of the spherically shaped bearings, in seismic isolation of museum artifacts and to identify the appropriate design parameters. In this study, a non-isolated single-degree-of-freedom model and a 2-degree-of-freedom model isolated with a single friction pendulum bearing inside a building were established for a museum artifact. A parametric study was conducted using the root mean square and the maximum accelerations and displacements of the isolated mass at different values of friction coefficient and effective radius of curvature, as well as the maximum displacement of the friction pendulum system. Afterward, the non-isolated and isolated mass responses were compared in the time domain based on selected parameters obtained from the parametric study.

        "abstract": "The efficiency of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms is crucial for optimizing the performance of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Traditional methods like the Perturb and Observe (P&O) algorithm are commonly used due to their simplicity, but they often suffer from issues such as slow convergence and oscillations around the maximum power point under changing environmental conditions. This study introduces an enhanced P&O algorithm by integrating it with Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), a nature-inspired optimization technique known for its robust convergence characteristics. The proposed hybrid P&O-HHO algorithm aims to accelerate convergence time and improve the overall tracking performance of the PV system. To maximize power from PV modules at varying sun irradiance levels, Harris-Hawks Optimization (HHO) is offered as a performance improvement method for the conventional Perturb and Observe (P&O) approach in photovoltaic systems. The proposed model encompasses a boost converter for DC-DC power controlled by an MPPT algorithm, a PV panel, and a resistive load. The MPPT algorithm proposed is founded upon the execution of a hybrid technique that combines Harris-Hawks Optimization, a new method inspired by nature, and the conventional P&O approach. The suggested method has been tested through simulation testing utilizing the environment created by MATLAB Simulink. The findings of the simulation illustrate that‎‎ the HHO-P&O MPPT algorithm, as described, successfully ‎identified the global maximum power point more ‎efficiently.‎ Additionally, it exhibited a rapid convergence speed, superior outcomes in comparison to the standard Perturb and Observe method, and a swift dynamic reaction.",

Then, the microfibers were separated from the wastewater with the help of a filter. The accumulated microfibers on the filters were examined using a light microscope, and their chemical composition was determined using micro-FTIR analysis. Furthermore, energy dispersive X-ray scanning electron microscopy (EDX/SEM) was used for analyzing the structure of microfibers. The findings revealed the presence of acrylic and cotton microfibers in the wastewater samples, with varying concentrations observed on different dates (0.058 g/L and 0.251 g/L), emphasizing the severity of the microplastic issue we currently face.",

Coordinate transformations, differential geometry and gear theory were applied to obtain the fabricated surfaces. In addition, the ranges of the helical design parameter are also examined.

Numerical examples were prepared to investigate the effect of design parameters on the fabricated gear geometry. For the accuracy and validity of the presented model, a comparison was made with a beveloid gear model in the literature.

        "abstract": "Today, one of the most effective methods to save fuel, especially in the aviation and automotive sectors, is to reduce weight. For this reason, materials with relatively lower specific weight are preferred in places where high strength material is required. The formability of materials with this feature is generally not suitable for cold forming. For this reason, hot forming methods are preferred. Among these methods, the induction hot forming method stands out because it provides rapid temperature increase, environmentally friendly and has low energy consumption. In this study, the effective parameters were determined and numerically analyzed so that the die can reach the desired temperature in the fastest and most appropriate way during induction hot forming. In the study, the designed die and rectangular coil model were analyzed with the finite element method according to different current values. Current values of 601A, 726A and 828A were given to the system, respectively, and the desired temperature was reached at 828A. Thermal stress times were calculated mathematically for all current values and it was observed that no current value reached a value that would cause thermal cracking.",

        "abstract": "The most important parameter determining real lifetime of transformers, which are generally designed to have a lifespan of around 30 years, is excessive temperatures exposed to winding insulations. If the temperature of the winding insulation exceeds the critical temperature, aging rate decreases below the expected value, while it is under the critical temperature the aging becomes much slower. Therefore, by accurately monitoring winding temperature of a transformer, it is possible to accurately determine the aging rate and remaining life. In this study, design and field application of a lifetime metering device that developed based on this information is explained. The calculation method first calculates average winding temperature using winding resistance that is obtained by the real-time currents and voltages. Next, the winding hot-spot temperature is calculated using top oil temperature of transformer, ambient and average winding temperature. Last, the aging rate and used/remaining life values of transformer are obtained by winding hot-spot temperature. In addition to monitoring the used/remaining life, the device can also generate warning and alarm signals for user depending on excessive temperature and perform energy efficient cooling control. The developed transformer lifetime metering device can not only present the data to user with a touch screen on it, but also transfer it to a server via wireless internet connection.",

The torque output of a PM synchronous machine can be predicted by looking at the I-power. This study investigates the torque of a PM synchronous six-phase machine by exciting its phase coils for the combination of conventional three-phase, double conventional three-phase, consecutive three phases of six-phase machine and double consecutive three phases of six-phase machine. This paper also investigates the way of driving a six-phase machine using the balanced three-phase supply. Firstly, analytical studies have been done for these exciting combinations. These analytical results indicate that symmetric six-phase machine can be driven using these combinations. Secondly, a PM synchronous six-phase machine has been designed in a finite element analysis (FEA) software.

        "abstract": "HVAC systems are important in buildings due to their significant energy consumption, impact on indoor air quality, and role in occupant comfort. Optimizing the operation and control of these systems is crucial for improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. Anomaly detection in HVAC systems aims to optimize energy consumption, improve thermal comfort and indoor air quality, detect and isolate sensor faults, and, more importantly, detect cyber-attacks. By analyzing system data for unusual patterns or unauthorized access attempts, anomaly detection can play a vital role in safeguarding HVAC systems against cyber threats. Detecting and isolating potential cyber-attacks can prevent disruptions in building operations, protect sensitive data, and ensure the continued functionality of HVAC systems securely and reliably. In this study, Gradient Boosting Regressor is used to improve the anomaly detection capabilities of HVAC systems. Traditional anomaly detection methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic nature of HVAC systems and may generate false alarms or miss critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose the application of Gradient Boosting Regressor, a powerful machine learning technique, to enhance anomaly detection accuracy and reliability. We evaluate the model's performance using real-world HVAC data, comparing it with existing anomaly detection methods. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the system's ability to identify anomalies accurately while minimizing false alarms. This research advances HVAC system security by providing a more robust and adaptive anomaly detection solution. Integrating Gradient Boosting Regressor into the cybersecurity framework of HVAC systems offers improved protection against cyber threats, thereby enhancing the resilience and reliability of critical infrastructures.",

On the other hand, the Forming Limit Diagram (FLD) is widely preferred to evaluate the deformation ability of sheet metals. Another important method used to measure the stretch forming ability of sheet materials is the Erichsen cupping test. In this test, the sheet metal clamped between the die and the blank holder is formed with a spherical punch, and the distance taken by the punch until crack formation begins on the sheet surface is defined as the Erichsen Index (EI). In this study, researches related to the effects of the factors arising from material properties and experimental conditions on FLD and EI values were compiled and evaluated. In general, it has been detected that the formability of sheet materials increases with the increase of the strain hardening exponent (n) and the temperature. In the literature, it was found out that the EI value got larger with the increase in sheet thickness and punch diameter, as well as with lubrication.",

Various CH4-CO2 biogas fuel mixtures were analyzed experimentally and numerically for a thermal power of 13 and 31 kW. In the experimental part of the study, the fuel mixtures were burned, and the temperature and the NOX were measured. The standard k-ε turbulence model and Eddy Dissipation Concept were used in the present study's numerical part. The model was validated with the measured data. The modeling results are in agreement with the measurements. Various fuel mixtures were then modeled to seek varying inlet temperature and O2 concentration effects on the combustion characteristics of the biogas fuel mixtures studied. It was concluded that as the amount of CO2 in the fuel mixture was increased the flame temperature decreased linearly from about 1900 K to 1775 K. NOx concentrations in the combustion product decreased from about 10 ppm to below 2 ppm. It was also concluded that air preheating and change in O2 concentration in the oxidizer affected the flame temperatures and NOx considerably.",

Missing values are handled in a manual process, and these values are picked randomly from the real data. After generating missing values, missing values are predicted using the correlation-based imputation method; furthermore, the margin of error between the estimated value and actual value was calculated.

Power consumed for cutting (Pc, kW) and work material temperature (Tmr, °C) were determined by online measurements. In offline measurements deviation value in diameter measurement (DDM, µm) was determined by measuring workpiece diameter, and surface roughness (Ra, µm) was measured. Through the HAM method, maximum reduction of 14.43% was achieved in the Pc value. While the DDM value is 80 µm in conventional machining in the same cutting conditions, it decreases to 50 µm in the HAM method. While the surface roughness (Ra, µm) value is 2,66 µm in conventional machining, it decreases to 2,42 µm in the HAM method. According to the statistical analysis results, the most effective process parameter on the DDM value and surface roughness is the feed rate (f). It is followed by the processing method. The HAM method was found to have a significant effect on both. Since preheating cannot be done simultaneously with cutting, the heat produced causes expansion in the volume of the work material. This makes it difficult to machine parts that have precise dimensional tolerances using the TIG-based HAM method.",

Throughout this work, a cost-effective force sensor was designed by integrating a compression spring, guides, a support frame and a linear variable differential transformer (LVDT). In this integrated system, the force applied at a specific magnitude and frequency from an external force measurement and feedback unit is converted into electrical signals by horizontal motion of the LVDT core. These electrical signals from the force sensor are digitized and fed back to the computer and data acquisition card. The digitized data transferred to the software developed in this study continuously compare with the reference data, enabling position-dependent force control. Experiments conducted with the force sensor placed between two hydraulic pistons controlled by a servo valve revealed that it caused the pistons to move right and left, providing the desired control of the system with the reference force input.

The best mechanical results in graphene nanoplatelet reinforced composites were obtained in 0.2% reinforced composites, and the failure load and elasticity modulus values were found as 903.13 N and 4.46 GPa, respectively. Furthermore, the tribological performance of the samples was examined under dry sliding conditions. The worn surfaces were examined using SEM. The incorporation of graphene nanoplatelet reinforcement has been observed to positively impact the wear resistance of the epoxy matrix material.",

Topology optimization contributes to minimizing emissions and environmental effects by increasing material utilization efficiency and manufacturing sustainability. The mechanical parking brake is still used in many vehicles. This study aims to contribute to the reduction in vehicle weight by applying topology optimization. In addition, it also purposes to promote sustainability in manufacturing by reducing material usage and energy consumption. A CAD model was created by considering the existing mechanism element dimensions. The parking brake lever mechanism component was evaluated using topology optimization and finite element analysis methods. Static analyses were performed using a finite element analysis program. The results of this analysis were used as input data for topology optimization. In the topology optimization, the response constraint mass was increased by 5 increments from 50% to 95%.  As a result, the maximum equivalent (von Mises) stress for the parking brake lever is 230,29 MPa, and for the ratchet is 11,559 MPa. The maximum total deformation value for the brake lever is 0,95853 mm and for the ratchet is 0,0079482 mm. The parking brake lever mass decreased by 18,48% from 0.27751 kg to 0.22622 kg. The ratchet mass decreased from 0.095042 kg to 0.061911 kg by 34.85%.",

Waste Comp-B samples were obtained from the munition in two different ways and different RDX recovery percentages and purity were achieved. Comp-B was obtained both mechanically directly from the ammunition and from the recycling process by melting the main filling of the ammunition with hot water and steam method. TNT was removed from the samples obtained by both methods by utilizing the solubility differences of TNT and RDX in Toluene and RDX was obtained (rRDX). The recovery efficiency was 94% for Comp-B obtained by the mechanical method and 77% for the hot water/steam melting method. As a result of the subsequent purification process, RDX purity for both methods was calculated as It was determined to be more than 99%.",

This is important for the safety of welded structures, because if the mechanical and thermal properties of these structures, which are used in many areas, can be determined in advance, they can be used more safely. In the study, flash butt welding method was preferred and holes were opened at regular intervals in the samples that were brought to appropriate dimensions for the welding process, and temperature values were measured and recorded using thermocouples and data loggers during the welding process. Additionally, the maximum temperature reached in the welding area was measured using a thermal camera during welding. Microstructural changes occurring in the joining regions of the welded test pieces were examined using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Micro hardness measurements were made to determine mechanical properties. Using the ANSYS program, three-dimensional models were created using the finite element method under the same experimental conditions and compared with the experimental results. As a result of this comparison, it was seen that the findings were compatible with the actual results. For this reason, it is emphasized that the use of simulation programs is important to predict the properties of welded structures and possible problems.",

Currently, theoretical, experimental, and numerical studies on this formation mechanism are still ongoing. In this research, the effects of cutting speed on the BUE formation mechanism and the resulting chip morphology were examined in detail, while keeping the cutting depth and feed rate constant. Experimental studies have shown that cutting speed directly influences the formation of BUE and the resulting chip morphology. The extent of this effect, along with details related to chip morphology and BUE formation, was analyzed by comparing scanning electron microscope images. Additionally, the relationship between cutting force values read from the machine monitor during cutting and cutting speed was also investigated.

The use of CMMs in enterprises significantly contributes to the increase in productivity and quality. Today, with the developing technology, the measurement accuracy of CMM devices has increased; better quality measurements have been made. Coordinate Measuring Machines can make measurements on the parts that come out of production at the micron level. Measuring tips called electronic precision probes are used in the measurement of parts processed with various manufacturing methods with CMM. With the probe, the measurement is made by touching the material from the determined points. The measurement signals of the contacted points are transmitted to the computer. Compliance of the desired geometric tolerances such as circularism, parallelism and perpendicularity with the specified standards and dimensions can be reported. Thus, the shape and geometrical defects of the manufactured part, measurement deviations are detected, and an increase in productivity and quality in production is ensured.

CAN has a very robust error recovery mechanism and the protocol uses a non-destructive bit-wise arbitration mechanism as the medium access method. Although this method provides collision-free medium access, it also limits the bus distance and CAN systems have to operate at limited bus lengths. This paper explains basic solutions to extend a CAN system and introduces a new approach with cut-through bridging. This solution helps a CAN system to exceed the physical distance barrier imposed by the protocol. Simulation results show that the CAN system distance can be doubled by a cut-through bridge without losing the original features of the system",

In thisstudy, the effect of magnetic field on heat convection is investigated due to proportionality of heat transferred by convection withthe velocity of fluid.On theoretical base of the study, Naver-Stokes, which comprises electromagnetic force to fluids, continuity andtemperature distribution equations are written as cylindrical coordinate system for the purpose of investigation of the flowoccurring inside the pipes.

From the equations written in cylindrical coordinate system, radial temperature distribution expressionshave been obtained with respect to magnetic field and other physical properties of the fluid by using temperature values from thisexpression.According to the results; it is found that heat convection is greater at the inner wall of pipe due to the fact that velocitygradient is higher at low values of magnetic field intensity at the inner wall of pipe.

In recycled paper production however, both primary fibres (short and long fibres) and secondary fibres are used.Secondary fibres divide into pre-consumer and post-consumer fibres. However these fibers are not as formal as primary fibersbecause of the re-processing.In this study, the differences in the dot area in offset printing applied to 1st.Pulp and various recycled papers that havediffering fibre structures have been identified. With this intention, 133 lpi and 175 lpi output resolutions are widely used for1st.Pulp and dot gains of 20%, 50% and 70% in test materials have been obtained. With the aim of examining the effect of dotarea in printing on recycled papers, enlarged images taken from the scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used. As a result,how does the dot area effect of the differences between the fibre structure and surface roughness of recycled papers, aredetermined in this study.Keywords: Recycled paper, surface roughness, dot area, deinking, bleaching1. INTRODUCTIONWith a daily calculation of 5 million tons, eachyear Europe produces approximately 2 billion tons ofused solid waste. Between the years 1970-1980 theincrease in the demand for recycled fibres was twotimes that of what was obtained from cellulose. Todayhowever, the demand for recycled fibres in WesternEurope is increasing four times faster than the demandfor fibres obtained from raw cellulose. Towards the endof 2001, the proportion of paper thrown away wasaround 98%. The amount of paper wasted in EasternEurope is 80% while it is expected to rise at a rate of41% for the whole world (1).In recent years recycling has increased. TheEuropean Waste Commission is preparing a formalsurfaces have higher gloss. Correlations between paperroughness and paper and gloss were studied also by Xuet. All (8)Using cellulose obtained from low intensity anddifferent tree materials, volume and opaqueness can beincreased. In proportion to similar used papers, surfaceroughness and absorption are found to be greater whilegloss and the binding strength of fibres have been foundto be low. These characteristics depend on the source ofthe fibre, recycling processes and on the productobtained (9).Although the production stages of recycledpapers are similar to that of papers produced directlyfrom cellulose, they are different in terms of fibrestructure, deinking and flatosyon chemical stages. As aresult, fibre structure and surface roughness also show adifference (10).In this study; by enlarging the dot area in offsetprinting of papers produced by recycling waste papersusing an scanning electron microscope, the differencebetween the dot area of various types of paper isidentified.2. MATERIAL AND METHOD2.1. Papers Used In The StudyIn this study, the printable parameters of recycledpapers have been realised after being printed withparameters that were developed for 1st. Pulp paper.With this intention, papers that have good/bad surfaceroughness, that are white/non-white and that have/havenot had deinking applied to it, have been chosen fromtwo companies that sell recycled paper in Turkey.The first three recycled papers used in theexperimental studies, are recycled papers, (P1,P2,P3)that have been produced from 50% waste paper ofwhich 20% of this is classified as post-consumer waste.One of the last two recycled paper (P4), is madefrom 65% pre-consumer waste, 10% post-consumerwaste and 25% raw cellulose fibres.The other of the last two recycled paper (P5), ismade from 75% recycled waste paper according toNAPM (National Association of Paper Merchants)valuations and 50% when equalized according toEurope EUGROPA values. Consequently, the amountof pre-used and post-used waste has been confused witha value that has not exactly been identified.Characteristics of papers used in the study:- 1st.

Fuzzy logic can be used to calculate the gain coefficients of the controller in the system by using the adaptive fuzzy method instead of a traditional algorithm for the adaptation mechanism. Normally, the rules of a fuzzy controller system are derived from the system's internal structure and system behavior using expert knowledge that has experienced the system. However, it is not possible to derive fuzzy rules based on expert human knowledge for all systems in this way. It is necessary to use different methods to derive fuzzy rules in highly variable behavior and nonlinear systems. In this study, an adaptive fuzzy controller design for dc motor was made using a learning-based reference model learning algorithm using fuzzy inverse model; It has been shown that it is applicable for dc motors with the results obtained.

        "abstract": "In this current study, delafossite type AgFeO2 materials were synthesized using the hydrothermal method. Depending on synthesis temperature (115, 155 or 180 oC) and NaOH mineralizer mass (1.0, 1.6, 2.0 or 2.4 g) amount, the delafossites were composed of either mixed-phase 3R/2H-AgFeO2 or single-phase 3R-AgFeO2 crystals. Higher temperatures and NaOH mass were helpful to the growth of µm-sized 3R (space group of R-3m) crystals while lower temperatures and mineralizer mass produced nm-sized 2H (space group of P63/mmc) crystals. The comparison of different delafossite samples revealed that the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) current was larger in mixed-phase materials. Also, the transition from two-phase system to single-phase system was accompanied with a sudden drop in OER current. On the other hand, the difference between the electrochemical behavior of 3R and 2H phase delafossite is discussed in detail by considering similar studies in the literature.",

One-story; three-story; and five-story elastic systems with all the same slab, column, beam sizes, and their orientations in the plane were investigated according to the Turkish Earthquake Building Code (TEBC-2018) by Response Spectrum Analysis (RSA). The obtained results are compared with the TEBC-2018 design parameters. The results showed accidental eccentricity is proportional to torsional stiffness and rotational response. If the rotational response increases, it leads to an increase in accidental eccentricity instead of translational stiffness and response in the direction where the earthquake strikes the structure. In addition, the proposed method was approximately the same as RSA for a single-story building by considering the effect of the accidental eccentricity. At the same time, it was found to be approximately 12-15% less for three- and five-story buildings. However, it was revealed from the results that the proposed method was more successful in estimating the additional (accidental) eccentricity effect than the current earthquake code.",

Short link analysis, machine learning and text analysis are the components used together in the proposed framework. First, a dataset was created for this purpose and the attributes of spam accounts were determined. Later, the hyperlinks in the messages in this dataset were analyzed through link analysis component. The machine learning component was modelled through attributes. Moreover, the messages of the social network users were analyzed through text analysis method. A web-based application of the proposed model was put into practice. As a result of the experimental studies carried out thanks to the framework, it was determined that the proposed framework showed a performance of 95.69 %. The success of this article was calculated according to the F-measure and precision evaluation metrics under the influence of sensitive content rate.

Population, GDP, imports, exports, and IPI are considered independent variables used in the ANN model. The future values of each of the independent variables are predicted by a GPRM model based on a univariate time series approach. ANN model is then employed to predict electricity demand based on the future values of independent variables. Secondly, four diverse electricity mix scenarios are developed considering the forecasted electricity demand. The sustainability evaluation of the scenarios is performed using TOPSIS method considering ten different criteria classified into environmental, economic, technical, and social categories. Furthermore, four diverse weight sets are determined for the given categories, and also a sensitivity analysis is carried out. Turkey’s electricity demand is found out as ≈ 384,569 GWh according to the prediction for the year 2030. The Scenario-(C), which has a comparatively higher percent of nuclear energy generation, is determined as the most sustainable electricity mix scenario according to evaluation with the TOPSIS method.",

Initially, muscle signals were taken from 6 paraplegic patients such as spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke patients, 2 hemiplegic patients and 4 healthy persons. Then, signals were analyzed by using signal processing techniques such as filtering, rectifying, Root Mean Square (RMS) and also by calculating the Max Voluntary Contraction (MVC). As a result, it was seen that hip muscles such as the Gluteus Maximus (GMA), Gluteus Medius (GM) and Iliopsoas (ILP) had lower MVC values in the hemiplegic patients than those of the SCI patients and the healthy persons. Additionally, when the signals that were obtained were analyzed, it was found that the activity of the Medial Gastrocnemius (MG) muscle could be used in determination of movement path and movement intention. Moreover, the EMG results of gait motion may be helpful in applying accurate amplitude and frequency stimulation in epidural stimulation (ES) therapy.",

However, the number of parameters that affect the strength of the printed part in 3D printers is quite high. In this study, the effect of printing angle on the mechanical properties of the specimens fabricated with 3D printer was investigated through experimental and finite elements method. PLA filament and different printing angles (0°, 45°, 90°) were used for printing the test specimens. Specimens were accepted as transversely isotropic in the finite elements analysis. The plastic behavior of the material was explained by Hill yield criterion. In the first stage of the study, results of finite elements analysis and experimental study for 0°, 45° and 90° printing angles were compared. Comparison results showed that the acceptance of transversely isotropic material and Hill yield criterion can be used to determine the strength of the printed part. In the last stage of the study, finite elements analysis was repeated for 15°, 30° 60°, 75° printing angles. The finite element analysis and experimental results showed that the mechanical properties and maximum load values of specimens increased significantly with increasing of printing angle.",

With this target, a back support design which is shaped according to the person's body ergonomics has been realized with the biomimetic design lens approach, absorbs the load acting on the waist and back contact surfaces depending on the weight of the person and offer comfort above standard. Various solutions found in nature were examined and it was decided to use the spine form in the targeted design, since hedgehog spines have high impact absorbing properties. In this context, the design made with 3 different action scenarios and the back support design used in present  were compared. In addition, the design was analyzed ergonomically using the REBA method. While performing the analysis studies, recyclable thermoplastic elastomer hydrogel material was preferred for spines.

In addition, blurry images of low quality can occur when thermal images are obtained. In this article, super resolution application has been carried out on a data set consisting of thermal face images obtained from two different thermal cameras. The specified data set was created differently from traditional methods, low resolution (LR) thermal images were obtained from a 160x120 thermal resolution camera, while high resolution (reference) images were obtained from a camera with a thermal resolution of 640x480. Later, unnecessary parts of these images were cropped and another study was carried out by focusing only on the face area. A deep learning model based on adversarial generative networks (GAN) has been developed for these applications. The success performance of the results was evaluated by the image quality metrics PSNR (peak signal to noise ratio) and SSIM (structural similarity index). It has been observed that the results of the application performed by focusing only on the facial areas are better than the results of the application with original images. In addition, this study gave positive results in terms of approximating the resolution of the thermal images obtained by the less costly thermal camera to the resolution of the thermal camera, which has a high cost and can obtain high quality images, especially visually.",

        "abstract": "Reinforced concrete-framed buildings are commonly preferred to other types of buildings in Turkey. In these types of buildings, a two-way slab with beams, flat, waffle, and ribbed slab types are widely used. In building design, determining the best slab type that will perform well under gravity and lateral loads, with the least cost, is required. However, the proper selection of slab type has generally been overlooked by designers due to the emphasis on other structural members, such as beams, columns and structural walls. For this reason, the structural contribution of floors to building design has not been adequately examined. This shortcoming must be inspected in detail starting from the very first step of the design stage of a building. This study assesses the effects of different slab types on multi-story reinforced concrete buildings by investigating their structural behaviors while trying to optimize their overall cost. For this purpose, a total of 36 structural models were constructed, analyzed, and designed according to the current Turkish Building Codes and Standards. The type of slab system (a two-way slab with beams, flat, waffle and ribbed), the number of floors (10, 20 and 30), and span length (6, 7.5, and 9 m) were selected as the key parameters in these analyses. The buildings were assumed to be office buildings located in a seismically-active zone in Istanbul. The results indicated that a two-way slab with beams was the most economical slab type for 6-meter spans, while the waffle slab was the most economical for spans larger than 7.5 meters. Based on these results, the flat slab was found to be the most expensive slab type in all cases. Out of all slab types, the two-way slab with beams exhibited better earthquake performance, while the waffle and flat slabs provided relatively poor earthquake performances.",

In order to overcome the problem, the operating characteristics of the pump must be determined at part load operating conditions as well as design point operating condition.  In this study, flow inside a vertical shaft axial flow pump is investigated experimentally. The experimental setup is designed and constructed for the laboratory tests. The pump which is designed and manufactured is tested in the test setup. The performance of the pump is determined by measuring the flow rate, inlet and outlet pressures, rotational speed and power input of the pump. The part load and over load operating regions are determined. Pressure variations are measured at various performance points with the piezoelectric pressure transducer placed in between impeller and diffuser blade passage. Simultaneously, comparisons are made with the vibration spectrums obtained in the pump.",

The production of alternative binders to the Portland cement has been studied for a long time. Geopolymers are materials that have the potential to be an alternative to the cement. It is well-known that geopolymers have a good high temperature resistance. However, the high temperature resistance of both conventional and geopolymer concretes is significantly affected by the type and properties of the aggregate. In this study, the resistance of geopolymer concretes produced by using limestone, river, basalt and slag aggregates to 600 and 900°C temperatures was determined by comparing their compressive strength losses. The geopolymer concrete produced with limestone aggregate was completely decomposed up on exposure to 900°C. However, the counterpart concretes produced with river, basalt and slag aggregates lost 32.9, 48.5 and 53.6% of their compressive strength, respectively.",

Moreover, the mechanical behavior of the material under load was investigated by Dynamic Mechanical Analyses (DMA). As a result, mechanical properties (hardness and storage modulus) have been improved by aging heat treatments. The highest hardness value was measured as 414HV after solution heat treatment at 900ºC and aging heat treatment at 300ºC for 75 minutes on the sample showing phase transformation at 80ºC. Furthermore, an increase in storage modulus and a decrease in tanδ value occurred. To benefit from super elastic properties of NiTi alloys, the necessity of using temperatures above the transformation temperatures was observed with the storage modulus measurements. Storage modulus value under transformation temperature was ~21500MPa while it was measured as ~28500MPa after the transformation was completed for the sample with 45°C transformation temperature.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, information security has a very important place in digital communication. Encrypting important information in end-to-end communications or hiding it by embedding it on a carrier is one of the methods used for information security. In some cases, methods are used in a mixed manner to increase security. An encrypted information can be hidden on the carrier or a hidden information can be encrypted and released into communication channels. The common purpose of these methods is to send the important information from the source to the target by transforming it into an incomprehensible form or before it gets into the hands of unrelated people.In this study, after giving brief information about steganography, the proposed color image hiding method is explained. In this method, first the data in the image or text to be hidden is randomly distributed using an expanded 1D logistic map, and then replaced with the least significant k-bits (K-LSB) in the colored cover image. It is aimed to increase information security by encrypting the information that is desired to be hidden. The success of the method is tested on images and texts of different sizes according to the number of bit planes in which the information will be stored. PSNR and MSE criteria, which are important safety evaluation criteria, are examined. PSNR and MSE are calculated as 54.4359, 0.23415 respectively in the process of hiding the 75x100 image using 1 bit plane, by the way PSNR and MSE are calculated as 56.7213,  0.13834 respectively in the process of hiding the 7500byte. PSNR and MSE  are calculated as 36.503,  14.5472 respectively in the process of hiding the 150x150 image using 4 bit plane, by the way PSNR and MSE are calculated as 38.657,  8.8585 respectively in the process of hiding the 22500byte. With experimental results, it is proven that the algorithm has good performance, good performance against statistical analysis attacks.",

It was then pressed with 500 MPa in a mold of 15x15 dimensions and sintered at 800o C for 45 minutes in a microwave sintering oven. It was then sintered and  green densities were measured. The alloying properties of the sintered samples were determined by performing metallographic examinations under optical and SEM microscopes. In addition, by measuring the Brinell hardness values, the effects of alloy ratios on hardness properties were determined.In this study, it is aimed to mechanically alloy Fe-Cu systems that are not mixed together and therefore not alloyed by traditional methods and to examine the alloying capabilities by looking at microstructure, hardness and density values over two different chemical ratios.",

        "abstract": "This study presents a value engineering study for sofa bed, which is an iconic/cultural furniture in Turkey, particularly based on the current trends among young customers. The aim is not only cost regulation but also to create value through design. During the design phase, mainly, the complaints and needs of the users are taken into account. The value engineering was implemented through preparation, implementation and evaluation phases. Participants responded to the data collection form including the features of the sofa bed through online methods. The survey data were collected and presented as graphs. A cost calculation was performed by determining the functions of the sofa bed and the cost of these functions. Following the cost calculation, a cost-benefit analysis was performed and the features with high-cost and low-benefit were determined. Customers’ preferences were presented with a QFD matrix and the preparation phase was completed after obtaining value indexes. During the evaluation phase, various factors such as developing ergonomic solutions in the sofa frame by taking the existing functions into account and consuming more sofa upholstery than demand were examined. Based on the customers’ complaints and requests, some solutions were presented such as adding a drawer and an openable mini coffee table to the product, disassembled frame, and an apparatus that allow end-users to assemble the frame. The value engineering and the phases of the study was applied to the alternative model. The data obtained were compared with a sample sofa bed product available in the market. In conclusion, a new highly preferable product was achieved that provides a cost reduction of $44 (equal to 370 TL at the current exchange rate) per product, as well as includes new functions and a new design that allows disassembled sales, unlike the disassembled sofas without base and bed available in the market.

Asphalt is generally used as pavement material on roads that provide transportation of vehicles such as cars and buses on the highway. Asphalt material is deformed due to weather conditions, heavy vehicle passage. In the smart city structure, similar deformations should be reported to the relevant unit. In this article, it was tried to determine the deteriorations on the asphalt by selecting the data set obtained from a region with image processing methods and deep learning technique. With the action camera placed in an automobile, a total of 4315 asphalt images with various distortions and without any deterioration were used as dataset. The dataset was classified using a pixel-based Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network. Accuracy, precision and sensitivity values were used to make the performance result obtained as a result of classification meaningful. With this proposed method, the average accuracy rate was 93.2%. With these results, an approach that can automatically detect asphalt deterioration in smart city structures has been developed.",

Although more than one year has passed since the emergence of the disease, statistics show that the peak number of patients have not reached yet. The spread of the increase in the number of patients over time is important to prevent hospital occupancy rates from hitting dangerous levels. For this reason, people carrying the virus should be diagnosed quickly and isolated from society until the disease is over. In this study, a comprehensive artificial neural network-based model has been proposed for rapid disease diagnosis using X-ray images. Using the damage created by the coronavirus in the lung tissues, the diagnosis can be made within seconds. The model subject to study improves and augments X-ray images by pre-processing. After training is performed using DenseNet201, ResNeXt-101(32×8d), VGG-19bn and Wide-ResNet101-2 networks, Covid-19 positive or negative diagnosis is provided from the image.

In this study, energy and exergy analysis of a natural gas-fired combined cycle power plant was carried out using the actual operational data of the power plant. The exergy efficiency of the power plant was determined to be 61.2 % as a result of the analyses performed under conditions where the ambient temperature and pressure were 25.4 °C and 98.1 kPa, respectively, while the component with the highest exergy destruction was the combustion chamber with 89 MW. The condenser was determined to be the most exergy efficient component of the power plant, with a 96.4 % efficiency rating. While the total power obtained from the power plant is 205 MW, the power of the Brayton cycle is 134 MW and the power of the Rankine cycle is 71 MW.

In this study, a total of 55 mixtures were organized by adding five different chemical admixtures (medium-high range water reducer, set accelerator-retarder and air entrained agents) in two different dosages to the blended mortar prepared by using different amounts of fly ash and slag (0%-12,5%-25% by weight of cement). After then, fresh and hardened mortar properties were determined on the specimens, and the results were analyzed by statistical analysis and graphical methods. As a result, the usage of superplasticizer led to a statistically significant change in strength, regardless of whether the mixtures were mineral admixtures added, while the dosage difference had its effect on all results. For other chemical additives, this effect has been limited. More importantly, the use of chemical additives in blended mixtures with mineral additives caused significant differences in strength and setting times compared to mixtures without mineral additives, while this situation was more experienced in slag mixtures. This is very important in terms of revealing how necessary trial castings are rather than ready-made predictions when chemical additives are used especially in blended mixtures with mineral additives.",

The design and dimensions of the MR damper piston were determined according to the static magnetic analysis results made in ANSYS/Emag (Electromagnetics) software. The MR damper’s damping performance was tested in laboratory by utilizing a damper testing device. The tests were carried out under different currents applied to coil of the MR damper. According to the test results, the equivalent damping coefficients of the MR damper were calculated for different currents. The test results show that the highest damping force is 169.4 N with frequency of 3.18 Hz and applied current of 2 A. In this case, the equivalent damping coefficient is 302 Ns/m. The equivalent damping coefficient is 181 Ns/m when no current is supplied to the coil. The area of the dynamic force range also becomes larger with increasing the applied current. In addition, according to the quarter car model based simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink, it was seen that the semi-active suspension system using MR damper was more effective and successful in vibration mitigation.",

Considering the heavy hours of traffic, it can be assumed that the position of the vehicle mass on the bridge is variable, but the total mass remains constant. This study aims to show that the damage to the closed systems can be successfully estimated by using a damage indicator that is valid for systems with constant mass distribution. In the analytical study, a 100-element 200 degree of freedom fixed-free beam is investigated and the assessment of the damage position is verified numerically and the validity of the parameter is examined in an experimental study. Except for the piece at the free end of the beam; It has been determined that the damage indicator calculated on the damaged elements is 60 times larger than the damage indicator calculated at the undamaged elements. In the elements at the free end of the beam; it was observed that this ratio is between 6 and 40 depending on the mass of the accelerometer. Therefore, a criterion for accelerometer mass and damage indicator is proposed.",

Fast neutron removal cross sections of the alloys were also calculated. It was observed that Inconel-617 has higher shielding ability than Incoloy-800HT. The shielding potentials of the alloys were compared with those of other shielding materials (ordinary concrete, hematite-serpenite, ilmenite-limonite, steel-scrap, basalt-magnetite, steel-magnetite and ilmenite concretes) reported before, and it was concluded that Inconel-617 and Incoloy-800HT have more shielding ability than those.",

With priority based bit-wise arbitration used in medium access control method, no time is wasted for collisions and the highest priority message is guaranteed to access the bus first. This provides a guaranteed low latency for real-time applications. On the other hand, since all the nodes have to observe each other’s transmission level within a single bit-time, the bus has to be at a limited length at a given bit-rate.

Furthermore, changes in life styles, in other words transition from a traditional life to a modern life, had caused to leave these houses with their own fates. The deterioration of the roofs of some houses had also caused the deformation of their ceilings and in the result it was thought suitable to demolish the roofs and ceilings entirely and renew them. In this study, the ceilings of the traditional houses in Kütahya and Emet were examined, among the ceilings of the room and hall. A great importance was given to examine the parts of traditional wooden ceilings which were caught the eye in respect of centre, corner and aesthetics. From this point of view; it was observed that there were similarities and differences among common production and decoration techniques, dimensions, upper surface procedures of the ceilings. It was determined that the wooden material which was used in producing the ceiling was black and yellow pine",

To overcome this difficulty, recently, researchers have frequently used wavelets which leads to a sparse matrix that can be solved easily by an efficient sparse solver. Using wavelets in solving EM integral equations has been widely studied. The purpose of this study is to develop a strategy for efficient wavelet solution of integral equations by connecting and using efficient studies have been done in this area.

Experiments was carried out between -4ᵒ and 26ᵒ angle of attack at 3 different velocities (6-7-8 m/s, 126000-147000-168000 the Reynolds number). According to the obtained results NACA 63-415 airfoil showed that CL/CD values are about 7 between 4ᵒ and 12ᵒ angle of attack when others are 4. After the angle of attack of 12ᵒ CL/CD values of NACA 63-415 airfoil decreased and until the angle of attack of 21ᵒ this airfoil has higher lift / drag ratios then other airfoils. As a result, wind power plants operating at low speed can be established in Kayseri with NACA.63-415 airfoil that has concluded that it is better to use in terms of efficiency",

However, because of the uncertainties embodied within the very nature of the maintenance and repair works, and the working load, most of the time, the funds based on the untruth-worthy bill of quantities remain below the approximate cost and this causes delays in the works or a complete collection of projects and returning the allocated funds back to the budget eventually. On the other hand, due to discounts, the tender prices usually remain within the limits of the funds allocated at the very beginning. In this paper, for the purpose of using the limited funds allocated for the maintenance and repair works effectively, by taking the factors effecting the bidding into consideration such as; approximate cost, and the city where the work is to be done, and contracting authority, and repair type, and bidding date, and duration of the work, and number of accepted bids, the correct estimates of contract prices have been studied. In this regard, the 211 bidding data concerning various maintenance and repair projects carried out by a public institute in 2015 have been analyzed using regression-correlation method. The results of the analysis have been tested by way of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and some comparisons made.

This assumption constitutes one of the basic novelties of the present investigation. For the verification, the numerical results of the mathematical model for an FGP curved actuator are compared with those of a related study on a linear FGP curved bar in the literature. Next, the model is used to determine the deformation and electrical behaviours of an FGP curved sensor under a couple at its free end section. The presentation of the numerical results for the curved sensors is another novelty of the present study since the numerical results in the related studies in the literature were presented just for the actuators. Results are compared with bimorph piezoelectric curved sensors and the effect of the grading parameter on the mechanical and electrical fields is examined. Numerical results show that FGP curved sensor provides several advantages in terms of the mechanical behavior of the material, and the distribution and production of electric potential in the sensor are affected significantly with the variation of grading parameter",

Therefore, energy planners have to design different policies to direct justifiable energy consumption for which various modeling techniques need to be adopted. In this study, the main idea is the causality relationship between electricity production - consumption demand and economical growth in per capita and aggregate levels in the emerging economies during the period 2003 - 2014 by using Cobb Douglas Model and Granger causality tests. Electricity production and consumption demand in Turkey are studied through economical models for residential and industrial sectors. Industrial sector is the largest electricity consuming sector in Turkey. The economical model developed here focuses on the use of only significant variables that are not collinear. Hence, statistical tests have been used to recommend significant economical models. In Turkey, between 2003 and 2014, while real per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth averaged 16.3% per annum, annual electricity production and consumption growth averaged 11.67 %. In spite of the fact that real per capita GDP and electricity consumption demand are positively correlated, it is still not clear the direction of causality between real per capita GDP, electricity consumption. The positive impact of electricity production and consumption demand on the economical growth and the bidirectional causality between economical growth and electricity consumption are evaluated. The analysis shows that not all the socio - economic variables used in other studies can be useful for model representation for Turkey’s electricity consumption. The chosen models provide a very small absolute difference with actual electricity consumption demand. Recently, government has been focusing in industrial development in non - hydrocarbon sectors. So, the study of electricity production and consumption in these two sectors is considered as significant. An understanding of relationship between electricity consumption and various socio - economic variables is expected to help the planners to make appropriate generation and transmission planning in the country",

The second part on the other hand consisted of the formulation of governing elastic equation coupled with the temperature gradient. This equation is nothing but the thermoelastic equation of the cylinder. Analytical solution of the thermoelastic equation reveals the distributions of stress, strain and displacement within the cylinder at a given time instant.

T6 heat treatment was applied to the produced A356 alloys. The microstructures of the produced A356 alloys were examined by optical microscope (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-Ray diffraction analysis (XRD) and hardness measurements. Wear tests were carried out on a pin-on disk type wear apparatus at 1 ms-1 sliding speed for different sliding distances (500, 1000, 1500 and 2000 m) under different loads (10, 20 and 30 N). The results showed that the morphology of Al-Si eutectic was refined and distributed uniformly in the microstructure with increasing Cu amount. In addition, iron-based intermetallic phases formed in the microstructure were also seen to be refined. With increasing Cu amount added to A356, the amount of Al2Cu precipitates (due to aging) and the hardness values of the alloys increased. According to the wear test results, while the lowest wear rates were obtained for A356 alloys with 0.2% and 0.4% Cu under 10 and 20 N loads, the lowest wear rate under 40 N load was obtained for A356 alloy with 0.4% Cu content",

As a result of similarity relations, one nonlinear ordinary differential equation is obtained and solved analytically with the appropriate assumptions. Moreover, excellent agreement was found between the obtained analytic solution and suggested simple parabolic approximation. Although it was found that in case where more effects are gradually being considered, a slight difference is emerged, but the most dramatic change between solutions occurs when solid to fluid ratio gets significant value. In addition, suitable match in the quantitatively and qualitatively aspects was found between literature results and obtained solution. In addition, analytical solution parametric investigation was performed for specific parameters choice. It was found that the normalized velocity was found to decrease gradually with the tangential direction progress and/or with friction coefficient increase. However, the normalized velocity profile gets higher values as long as the solid to fluid ratio increases. Additionally, Reynolds, Hartmann and solid volume fraction coefficient increase (separately or all together) have raised the normalized velocity function values. Finally, unprevail distinguished cases were introduced to understand flow complexity. It was found that the electrical field magnitude effect is significantly, especially for small friction coefficient values and for high wedge semi angle. Also, the combination between small friction coefficient values including small parameter flow values (Re and Ha numbers) and high electrically field may lead to un-optimized course of normalized velocity profile. The last case that was examined is concerned with friction coefficient variation effect on the normalized velocity profile for different values of wedge semi angle with high electric field for specific parameters choice. It was found that increasing friction coefficient leads to normalized velocity profile consolidation.",

The foundation medium is assumed to be linear, homogenous and isotropic, and it is modeled by the Pasternak model with two parameters for describing the reaction of the elastic foundation on the beam. Firstly, the equation of motion of non-homogeneous beam subjected to axial force resting on Pasternak foundation is provided within the frame work of Bernoulli-Euler beam theory. The resulting equation is solved according to the simply supported boundary conditions. To show the accuracy of the present results, a comparison is performed and a good agreement is achieved. The effects of non-homogeneous material properties, elastic foundation parameters and axial load on the values of frequency parameters of the first three modes are examined",

In recent years, studies depending on advances in semiconductortechnology showed that voltage collapse in the power systems can be prevented and dynamic stability in the power systems canbe improved if reactive power compensation is done with semiconductors. In this paper, three-phase 3-level cascade inverterbased on D-STATCOM of ±25kVAR connected to secondary of distribution transformer is simulated for purpose of loadcompensation. For this aim, distribution system, D-STATCOM and control unit are modelled with MATLAB/Simulink veSimpower Systems and D-STATCOM’s performance for load compensation is investigated in terms of switching on/offinductive and capacitive loads that they have different power values",

While comparing a 1000 MW nuclear power plant and 1000 MW thermal power plant, the thermal power plant exposses radiation 490 rem/year per person due to the fact that coal consists of uranium 1,3 per billion and toryum 3,2 per billion. The nuclear power plant exposes radiation only 4, 8 rem/year per person. It is clear that the thermal power plant having the same power with nuclear power plant exposes radiation 100 times higher than the nuclear power plant. For this reason, modeling a radiation control system around thermals power plant has been proposed. By this system, the radiation of environment is controlled by central control unit.

The balance equations are then solved subject to a phase constraint which identifies the resonant solution only. The amplitude of the response at resonance, and the frequency at which resonance occurs, can therefore be obtained without needing to compute the response over a wide frequency range. This provides an efficient toll for investigating the dependence of the resonant response on the level of input excitation, with results which agree well with more time-consuming simulation methods",

When FE simulations are completed for the orthogonal cutting process of 20NiCrMo5 steel, the cutting tool is  withdrawn and the stresses are relieved. The results reveal that the machined surface is tensile stresses. The estimated residual  stresses are also compared with experimentally measured data available in the literature.

In the present study, new and strange phenomena, which is encountered in a newly-developed circuit, namely R2L2D circuit is reported. This new phenomena, which we called as the \"sweep up/down effect\" has been observed when the successive dynamic responses of the circuit have been explored by only adjusting the peak-to-peak amplitudes Vpp at a constant feeding frequency, namely f = 65 kHz. In one of our recent paper [13], this new circuit has been explored for a wide feeding amplitude and frequency regimes, whereas this effect has not been recognized at that time due to the lack of sensitivity. However, the detailed observations prove that the sweep up/down effect governs the identification of the dynamics in terms of periodic and chaotic regimes. Thus it gives a kind of uncertainty region at the threshold of the regimes depending on the feeding voltage increase or decrease. Besides, for a certain system parameter, i.e. Vpp, the chaotic and periodic region co-exists phenomenologically. This effect becomes vital for the synchronization and encryption studies in the sense that the decrease/increase in amplitude certainly yield to regular or chaotic behavior in the output. In addition, the transitions from regular regime to the chaotic one or vice-verse takes place without any period doubling procedure apart from the traditional observations",

The experimental studies were carried out on C25 concrete samples produced according to the standard TS EN 206-1. Cold joints were formed at the angles of 45 and 90 degrees in the concrete samples, which were produced in the shape of a 100x200 mm cylinder and a 100x100x500 mm prism. Test samples were prepared first by pouring the half of the concrete samples and forming the cold joint after waiting 2, 3, 4 and 6 hours, and then by pouring the remaining half of the concrete. Direct tensile and flexural strength tests were conducted on these samples. The results showed that during the formation of cold joint, a longer period of time led to a decrease on the direct tensile and flexural strength of the concrete. This decrease was more evident on the concrete samples poured after 6 hours",

        "abstract": "In this study, Generalized Predictive Control (GPC) algorithm is applied to a process simulator which wireless temperature experiments were achieved and the results of the experiments were compared under the same conditions obtained. To achieve the data transfer between computer in Process Control Laboratory and the process simulator in Unit Operations Laboratory, wireless communication system was established and wireless experiments were performed on-line by means of MATLAB/Simulink program. Wireless data transfers during the experiments were carried out by using radio waves at a frequency of 2.4 GHz. In wireless temperature control experiments which are conducted using with algorithm of GPC, all L (control weighting) values which are bigger than 1.0 are not suitable for temperature control because the heater made very big oscillatory behaviour and consequently temperatures also made very big oscillatories at any NU (control costing horizon), N1 (minimum costing horizon) and N(maximum costing horizon) values. Therefore GPC experiments were carried out in L values smaller than 1.0. Changes of temperature profiles were observed with time as a result of experiments carried under the same conditions, using the NU, N2 ve L parameters in the GPC algoritm to the NU=1.0; N1=1.0; N2=2.0; NU=1.0; N1=1.0; N2=4.0; NU=2.0; N1=1.0; N2=2.0 ve NU=2.0; N1=1.0; N2=4.0 values for the L=0.001; 0.005; 0.01; 0.05; 0.1 and 0.5 values. According to the experimental results analyzing the temperature profiles, the temperatures the N1=1.0 and N2=2.0 values of control was closer to the set point and oscillations were found to be less than according to the values of NU=1.0; N1=1.0; N2=4.0; NU=2.0; N1=1.0; N2=2.0 ve NU=2.0; N1=1.0; N2=4.0. Also by increasing the value of Nu and N2 temperatures are begin to move away from the set point and the oscillations are increased. Wireless experiments conducted under the same conditions for Tset=50 °C and Tset=60 °C which using the best temperature control parameters with the L=0.001; 0.005; 0.01; 0.05; 0.1 and 0.5 values were determined with the integral of the square of the error (ISE) and the integral of the absoluteof the error (IAE) values. According to the experiments carried out at the lowest values of ISE and IAE were determined that the value L = 0.01. In addition, lower and higher values of L=0.01 calculated ISE and IAE values were higher and that can be seen the temperature away from set point. In conclusion, the best temperature control is obtained NU=1.0; N1=1.0; N2=2.0 and L=0.01 values",

Equations are solved by using a numerical method based on the Taylor series. By means of introducing practical specific values, the dynamic and thermodynamic behaviors of the engine were examined. Variations of several engine performance parameters with engine speed and charging pressure were examined. The brake thermal efficiency, cooling loss, friction loss and exhaust loss of the engine were predicted as about 37%, 28%, 4%, and 31% respectively for 3000 rpm engine speed and 1 bar charging pressure.

Grinding, polishing and etching were applied to the surface of the welded samples in order to ascertain the microstructure and micro hardness characteristics of the samples. Generally the hardness values of all the welded joints decreased from base the plate towards the stirred zone. Base metal exhibited elongated grains in rolling direction and its micro hardness was determined to be 45 HV. The heat affected zone displayed a coarse-grain structure and its micro hardness was 27-38 HV. The experiments have shown that the grains on the thermomechanically affected zone oriented towards the direction of the rotation of the stirring pin. The hardness of this zone was higher than that in the heat affected zone. It was also determined that fine equiaxed grains were formed in the stirred zone due to dynamic recrystallization",

Typical microstructure of P/M Rene 95 compacts produced at sub-solvus temperature exhibited a uniform dispersion of a few underformed powder particles in a fine grained microdublex matrix. Later, to investigate the heat treatment effect on grain size, some compacts were applied to heat treatment for 1 hour at a sub solvus temperature of 1100oC followed by fast cooling. The other compacts were applied grain coarsening treatment of 2 hours at super-solvus temperature of 1200 oC followed by slow cooling. The average grain sizes were measured as 7 µm fine, and 50 µm coarse grains respectively",

After the earthquakes some studies shown that collapsed or damaged structures were high buildings. Damage situation of these buildings were determined by the Ministry of Public Work and Settlements staff. Buildings were classified light, medium, and heavy. They were maintained and reconstructed. In this study, concrete and steel samples from collapsed and damaged buildings were collected and investigated their engineering behaviors. Besides this, the recent concrete and steel samples which would be used in new buildings were also collected and tested. The effects of corrosion on engineering properties were also considered and compared with other groups of the mild steel. One year atmospheric pollution caused corrosion which decreases the engineering properties of this materials, hence they were out of standard. Also some tests were carried out to the effect of high deformation speed on the engineering properties. In high speed tensile test; reinforcement steel bars have suddenly strain hardened and this caused brittle fractures. The present study shown that the mild steel which had been used in the previous buildings were cold and hard rolled and they were produced in the local workshops. These were far from the standards. The reinforced bars used in the recent buildings have showed perfect mechanical behaviors within the standards. Parallel to the results of old mild steel (%75), concrete in old buildings have also shown nearly 60% out of standard",

In the second stage, new brake linings were produced by adding some sepiolite powder to the bronze based lining material (0, 5 – 4 %). The wear behaviour of these sepiolite added new brake linings was determined and a comparison was made with the bronze based ones. For this purpose, density, friction coefficient, friction force and mass loss of the brake lining’s specimens were determined. Microstructure photographs of the specimens before and after testing were taken and the worn surfaces were examined using SEM to determine wear mechanisms. Optimum friction-wear behaviour of bronze based brake lining was obtained using samples pressed at 350 MPa sintered at 820 oC. Wear resistance and friction coefficient values of all the brake lining specimens were found to be in the range specified in SAE-J661 standard. In terms of wear resistance, the best result was found on 0,5 % Sepiolite containing specimen while 2 % Sepiolite containing specimen gave the best result in terms of friction coefficient",

The results demonstrated that small nanoparticles promoted fastnanoparticle accumulation in bothcancer cells in comparison to large particles. Small nanoparticlesexhibited higher cytotoxicity in cancer cells with lower half maximalinhibitory concentration (IC50) values than large nanoparticles in48 h. On the other hand, both nanoparticles showed similar IC50values after 72 h prolonged exposure. Moreover, it was found that smallnanoparticles increased the number of apoptotic cells in 24 h, whereas large nanoparticlesinduced apoptosis when exposure time increased to 72 h.

However, a tremendous increase in the use of dynamic web and mobile applications has resulted in security vulnerabilities originating from the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) coding system. Site-to-site Script Execution (XSS) attack is the largest contributors to security exploits. There are different models according to the dynamic content that XSS attacks use. The interest of the study is composed of attacks on visual content with the \"img\" tag. In study, an algorithm has been developed to detect XSS attacks with the decision tree which is motivated by the fact that they tend to be easier to implement and interpret than other quantitative data-driven methods. The algorithm that successfully classifies 392 of 400 malicious and clean codes in the data set with 8 different features. This result contributes to the use of secure internet without XSS attacks that use visual content..",

Layers of 50% Ni-50% Al powders were mixed with 3%, 6% and 10% of Co and Cr powders. These were mixed for 12 hours in a rotational container with a speed of 300 rpm. Mixed powders were cold compressed in a mould with pressures of 50, 100 and 200 MPa. The obtained samples were then synthesized in an argon controlled atmosphere with and without preheating to 250 oC. The microstructure of synthesized samples was analysed using SEM-BSE, EDS and XRD. The EDS results showed that the samples were containing Ni in majority along with Al, Co, and Cr. To determine the phase components, XRD spectra was analysed and the peaks of NiAl, Ni3Al, and NiAl3 were confirmed with NiAl having the highest peak intensity. The density calculations showed that the ratio of pores was affected the most from pressure. The main reason for this was attributed to the better contact of the powders under higher pressure which helped an uninterrupted reaction. The highest pore ratio values were obtained from samples produced under 50 MPa pressure.",

For this purpose, binary and ternary binders were prepared with partial replacement of cement with either fly ash (15wt% and 30wt%) or silica fume (5wt%) or both mineral admixtures (15wt+%5wt% and 30wt%+5wt%). An alkali reactive basalt aggregate was used in this study. It was found that partial replacement of cement with high-lime fly ash reduced the strength of mortar mixtures even up to 28-days. Besides, addition of 5% silica fume had not a significant effect on the early strength of fly ash-bearing mixtures. However, silica fume inclusion improved the 28-day strength of mixtures. In terms of alkali-silica reaction (ASR), the fly ash with lower lime content reduced the 14-day expansion more than that of fly ash with higher lime content. The opposite results were the case in 28-day ASR expansions. The ASR expansions of the fly ash-bearing mixtures were significantly reduced by the introduction of the additional 5% silica fume to these mixtures. However, silica fume incorporation remarkably increased the drying shrinkage values of the mixtures. Finally, fly ash with higher lime content was found to be more satisfactory in terms of compressive strength, alkali-silica reaction and drying shrinkage in the ternary binder system.",

The proposed iterative procedure isproved reliable by comparing the results to those generated by a SIE (SingularIntegral Equation) approach for isotropic laterally graded half-planes.

Then, 3D model of the respective generator is acquired to examine theeffect of magnet geometry on the cogging torque produced. In that context, theeffects of splitted and skewed magnet structures are examined. In the first design,the magnet is modelled with one piece and the rms value of the cogging torqueis found as 436.75 mNm. In the second case, a certain skewed slit is madealongside the magnet and that yields a slightly reduced cogging torque of434.58 mNm. In the other design, the magnet of the first design is divided intotwo sub-parts, which are then combined together in a skewed fashion. Thus, thevalue of cogging torque is found as 159.60 mNm. Eventually, by making twocertain slits on the last model, cogging torque is further depressed down to89.95mNm. It is concluded from the obtained results that the last designcontributes an improvement in the value of cogging torque up to 80% compared tothe initial design.",

        "abstract": "Seismic behavior of the structures is determined by using various dynamic parameters. The parameters are obtained depending on the existing structural characteristics of the structures, material properties, boundary conditions and damage condition. Modal analysis is a method used in civil engineering to solve complex structural dynamic problems. Minaret structures, because they are long and thin masonry structures, are sensitive to seismic effects. Due to its slenderness effect, significant damage to the structures occurs in severe earthquakes. In this study, linear dynamic analysis of the minaret of Hızırbey Mosque, which was built in 1383 at Kırklareli, was performed. The mosque is a restored structure, by using structural restoration report of the mosque, the dimensions of the minaret were determined. Studies on the stone-based construction material used on the walls of the structure, were carried out and material properties were determined. Due to the historical value of the mosque, nondestructive testing methods were used and modulus of elasticity of the material was obtained. The dynamic analysis of the minaret was performed in SAP2000 software by using mode superposition method in Turkish Earthquake Codes (TEC 2007 and TEC 2018). Furthermore, the minaret was modelled with prismatic frame elements and obtained results were compared to the results of shell element modeling. Within the scope of this study, an approach based on the Rayleigh method was proposed for the analytical evaluation of the fundamental period of the minaret. At the end of the study, it is seen that the force and displacement obtained according to the TEC 2018 is greater than TEC 2007. In addition, it was observed that modeling with frame elements gave close values to modeling with shell element. The fundamental period of the minaret with the Rayleigh method proposed in the study was found very close to the result obtained by the finite element method.",

The same element is also validated forfirst-ply failure analysis and good agreement is observed with the first-plyfailure loads obtained using a shear deformable and curved shell element. Then,numerical results for free vibration analyses are presented for axiallycompressed composite cylinders having different boundary conditions and forwhich the level of axial compression is kept below the corresponding linearbuckling and first ply failure loads. It is observed that, the fundamental freevibration frequencies decrease sharply for axial load levels higher than about60~80% of the buckling loads of the cylindrical structures considered.

        "abstract": "The coals with different initial moisture content to be used in the theoretical analysis were tested according to the related test standards and the results were used in the analysis. In the designed system, waste heat in the flue gas is used as the heat source. The fresh air is heated for drying in the shell-tube heat exchanger by means of flue gas. In fluidized bed dryers, the moisture of the coal was reduced by contacting the raw coal with the drying air. Due to the high initial moisture of the coals used in the theoretical analysis, the pre-drying degree could be at most 0.14 in order that the boiler feeding rate be the same as in the power plant feeding rate without pre-drying system. The system theoretically does not conform to the design parameters and the boiler feed rate is less than the flow rate of power plant without pre-drying system when the pre-drying degree is greater than 0.14. The pre-drying system had ten small capacity dryers working simultaneously to ensure the continuity of the boiler feed. In the study, the theoretical analysis was performed, and thermal performance of the power plant were formulized and graphically presented according to pre-drying degree. Thanks to the pre-drying system, owing to the decrease in the moisture content of the coal, a reduction in the flue gas flow rate and the amount of energy required to evaporate the moisture are realized. As a result, there was a decrease in the boiler losses and an increase in the efficiency of the boiler. The increase in boiler efficiency was 10.74% when coal 1 had been used and it was 7.92% when coal 2 had been used. Since the coals are dried in the same drying system under the same conditions, the moisture of coal 1 decreases more, thus the losses of the boiler decrease more. Due to the increase in the lower heating value and in the boiler efficiency, the efficiency of the power plant with pre-drying could increase by 3.04-4.34%. The coal pre-dried power plant had far more economic performance than a power plant without pre-drying system, since more electricity would be obtained thanks to the increase in efficiency of the plant. The redemption period of the system was determined as 2 years with coal 1 and it was determined as 3 years with coal 2. After the payback periods, the system makes a net profit and brings in an average of 55 million TL extra income per year. In addition, it was observed that when the degree of pre-drying was decreased, economic efficiency of the system also decreased. It is aimed that the study will provide principles of energy efficiency improvement in coal fired power plants with pre-drying system and will guide people who wants to do similar studies.",

Thus, it is aimed to minimize the damage that occurs when the event occurs or to maximize the benefit to be obtained. Studies on the prediction of subsequent events in many different areas, such as the prediction of the subsequent behavior of a customer, the prediction of the subsequent occurrence of natural disasters, the estimate of the number of future demands in a given time interval, are gradually increasing. However, in the literature, there is no successful study for predicting the time and type of event before the occurrence of crimes and emergency calls. Crime analysis is a field of research aimed at securing the threatened areas, reducing the rate of crime and saving law enforcement. High success is achieved with the use of up-to-date technologies in the efforts to resolve the crime shortly after it is committed. Similarly, emergency call analysis reduces response time and optimizes resource usage. In this study, a deep learning based prediction model for crime and emergency call analysis has been developed. With the developed model, the time of the next crime and the time of the next emergency call are predicted. The results obtained with the developed model has been compared with ARIMA which is one of the statistical time series prediction methods. Experimental results have shown that the developed deep learning-based model is more successful than ARIMA in forward-looking event time prediction.",

        "abstract": "Intersections, which have a great role in the safe and effective operation of traffic in the transportation system, are categorized according to their grade level, geometric properties, and control type. A roundabout is the type of grade level intersections, in which vehicle passages around the island are provided through circulatory roadway and vehicles gives priority to the traffic around the island. Each geometric element of roundabouts plays a role in the operation, capacity and safety of the roundabout. A well-designed roundabout helps optimize intersection safety by ensuring that vehicles' speeds remain constant along the circulatory roadway. This article examines the effects of geometric elements of roundabouts on intersection safety. In the light of the studies in the literature each geometric element of the roundabouts, the relationship with the intersection safety and the design criteria included in the standard/guidelines of some countries are investigated. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that the designs of roundabouts geometric elements are of crucial importance in terms of intersection safety. The lack of detailed studies on this subject in our country has been the motivation of our study. It is also seen that there is a lack of information about which roundabouts are built depending on the standards/guidelines in our country. As a result of the study, it was stated that geometric elements should be designed in roundabouts with each other and proper physical dimensions to ensure safety at roundabouts. In addition, it is stated that in terms of traffic safety, work on this subject should be started immediately and the design standard/manual specific to the conditions of our country should be prepared.",

The soils around energy structures must retain without any changes at their engineering properties against temperature changes or thermal cycles. Pumice is used for increasing strength of materials against high temperature. It is expected that when the pumice is added to the soil, it may increases the strength of the sand-bentonite mixtures under high temperatures. For that reason, 10% and 20% pumice were added to sand-bentonite mixtures and compaction, consolidation behaviors at room temperature were investigated. In addition, the shear strength behavior of 10% bentonite-sand mixtures in the presence of 10% and 20% pumice additive under room temperature and 80C was investigated. According to the results of the consolidation tests, the total vertical strain increased as the pumice content in the mixture increased. According to the results of direct shear test, it was observed that pumice additive under room temperature and 80C increased the internal friction angle of 10% bentonite-sand mixtures. Especially under high temperature (80C), the internal friction angle of the sample increased when 20% pumice additive was added.",

        "abstract": "Frequent subgraph mining (FSM) is a subsection of graph mining domain which is extensively used for graph classification and graph clustering purposes. Over the past decade, many efficient FSM algorithms have been developed. The improvements generally focus on reducing time complexity by changing the algorithm structure or using parallel programming techniques. FSM algorithms have another problem to solve, which is the high memory consumption. In this study, a new approach called Predictive Dynamic Sized Structure Packing (PDSSP) have been proposed to minimize the memory requirement of FSM algorithms. Proposed approach redesigns the internal data structures of FSM algorithms without any algorithmic modifications. PDSSP has two contributions. The first one is the Dynamic Sized Integer Type (ds_Int) which is a newly designed unsigned integer data type. The second contribution is “Data Structure packaging” component that uses a data structure packing technique which changes the behaviour of the compiler. A number of experiments have been conducted to examine the effectiveness and efficiency of the PDSSP approach by embedding it into two state-of-art algorithms called gSpan and Gaston.  Proposed implementation have been compared to the official one. Almost all results show that the proposed implementation consumes less memory on each support level. As a result, PDSSP extensions can save memory and the peak memory usage may decrease up to 38% depending on the dataset.",

The tensile properties, transmittance, opacity, water vapor permeability (WVP), antimicrobial activity, and release behavior of trilayers were determined. The elastic modulus (EM) of trilayer films were not significantly affected by the N content, while higher N concentrations resulted in higher tensile strength (TS) values. The incorporation of G led to higher elongation values and resulted in lower EM and TS values. Film samples, including N, presented lower WVP values, whereas higher WVP and water solubility values were obtained with G inclusion (p<0.05). L* and transmittance values increased with the increasing N content while the opacity values decreased (p<0.05). Furthermore, films added G showed significantly higher a* and b* values. The addition of N caused slower release of G from CH films through the selected food simulants. The obtained trilayer films also inhibited selected main pathogenic bacteria. The fabrication of PCL and CH films in the trilayer form enhanced the properties of CH and made these films more appropriate for food packaging.",

However, heavy minerals can preferentially settle to the bottom, making the polished surface rich in heavy minerals. Therefore, polished sections will become biased estimates of the volumetric (3D) map. The study aims to test whether any vertical cross-section (any section along the settling direction of particles) can be an unbiased estimate of the 3D mineral map of a chromite ore sample. For the purpose of this study, 2D maps of the vertical cross-sections were acquired by using Random Forest classification coupled with image pre- and post-processing tools. Then, 3D mineral maps were converted from 2D maps without assuming stereological errors. The modal mineralogy and particle size distributions predicted from 3D maps were compared with the same features estimated from the particulate sample by XRD and dry sieving analyses, respectively. Any 2D map which yields a modal mineralogy and a size distribution similar to the true analyses was selected as an unbiased estimate of the true 3D map. The results suggest that any vertical cross-section is an unbiased estimate, unlike polished section at which heavier minerals settle preferentially.",

Also, linear, quadratic, and cubic fuel cost functions were used to estimate the fuel cost parameters. Different fuel types such as coal, oil and gas were preferred for simulation studies. The results achieved from the semidefinite programming method were compared with that of particle swarm optimization (PSO), artificial bee colony (ABC), crow search algorithm (CSA) and least error square (LES) methods, respectively.

Circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boilers are one of the power generation technologies that can use oxy-fuel combustion design successfully. The purpose of this paper is to perform the techno-economic feasibility analysis of the commercial-scale oxy-fuel combustion circulating fluidized bed (oxy-CFB) power plant generating 550 MWe net power with a carbon capture rate of 90%. So far, economic analysis of oxy-PC power plants has been studied by researchers at many reports.  Nevertheless, the cost of an oxy-CFB power plant has rarely been studied.This is the first study that has used Turkish lignite (Orhaneli Coal) in an oxy-CFB carbon capture plant economic analysis. The basic economic performance indicators were investigated. The Models are based on cost scaling and Discounted Cash Flow analysis. Three cases were analyzed: In the first case, A base scenario (air-fired CFB plant without  CO2 capture) is considered and then based on this baseline scenario the other scenarios are taken into account. The economic viability of transition from the classical air-fired CFB plant system to oxy-CFB with CO2 capture and compression plant is evaluated. The post-combustion monoethanolamine (MEA) based CO2 capture system is investigated as a benchmark study to compare oxy-CFB capture system performances. The main applicability parameters suchas cost of electricity (COE), levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and the cost of CO2 capture for each case are calculated. The obtained results indicated that 54% and 52% increase in terms of total plant cost and COE respectively in the oxy-CFB plant when compared to air fired-CFB without carbon capture. Considering the COE, the designed oxy-CFB power plant is greater than the air-fired SC-PC (without capture) plant by more than 45% (DOE target). The efficiency penalty for oxy-CFB is 10%.  Oxy-CFB plant has a net efficiency 2% point higher than amine-based CO2 capture systems. In amine-based CO2 capture system; The capital costs, LCOE, and cost of CO2 captured are higher than the oxy-CFB plant. The results show that the oxy-CFB power plant has a lower cost for carbon capture compared to amine-based capture plant.",

In order tomake remedial measures for the landslides, the residual shear strengthparameters formed in the shear plane during the landslide must be estimated asclose to the reality as possible. These parameters can be determined bymulti-reversal direct shear, ring shear tests, back calculations, correlationsin the literature by means of physical properties of the soil. The difficultyof predicting the groundwater conditions during landslide is obvious and itdirectly affects the residual shear strength values ​​when shear strengthparameters are determined using the back analysis method. On the other hand, residualshear strength parameters obtained from the literature can give a wide range. Besides,ring shear tests are not commonly performed in laboratories and depending onthe type of soil, multi reveral direct shear tests may need to be performed atvery low speeds. Relatively long test time adversely affects the practical useof the multi reversal direct shear tests. In this study, the relationshipbetween peak and residual shear strength in normally consolidated high plasticclays was studied within the framework of the above restrictions. Firstly,the empirical correlation between the residual shear strength and the index porpertiesand peak shear strength was predicted by evaluating the results of the studiesin our country's literature. Then, the results obtained from the multi reversaldirect shear tests with remoulded high plastic clay samples and the predictedvalues ​​were compared.",

Although they are sensitive, they can be easily installed in any environment with their outdoor protection designs. Changes in physical sizes such as temperature and stress cause linear changes in FBG's central wavelengths. In FBG sensing systems, the detection of the central wavelength of the reflected signal is one of the most important research subjects. Although different approaches have been studied for the determination of the central wavelength of FBG, the most common approach is to accept the wavelength corresponding to the highest power value of the signal as central wavelength. Several techniques are used to determine the wavelenght with this highest power value. The most stable method among these methods is the Gaussian fitting method. In this study, the Gaussian fitting method for the determination of the central wavelength of FBG in response to temperature changes has been theoretically and experimentally examined. As a result, the temperature measurement was taken from 5 FBG arrays, the signals were processed, and the temperature detection system was realized.",

        "abstract": "A critical failure mode is encountered in double symmetric steel I-beams, which is known as lateral distortional buckling (LDB), when the web slenderness ratio of the section is relatively high. LDB is a buckling mode arising through the interaction of the well-known lateral torsion buckling (LTB) and web buckling, i.e. local buckling (LB), modes. Web slenderness and flange compactness have significant effects on LDB. This study focused on the inelastic LDB behavior of doubly-symmetric steel I-beams. The inelastic behavior increases and web distortions take place with the initiation of yielding in the web (between neutral axis and compression flange) with decreasing beam length. Generally, web distortions are encountered more commonly in the inelastic range of buckling. In this study, analytical limiting unbraced length (Lr) values of the beams with different web slenderness values from the inelastic LTB (Lr) formula of the Turkish Steel Structures Design Code (TSSDC 2016) were compared to the respective finite element results. Lr values were observed to increase due to web distortions. Yielding was determined to be the most influential parameter on web distortions. As a result of LDB, numerical Lr values were higher than the respective analytical estimates from code formulations. However, as the web slenderness of the section increases, the numerical-to-analytical Lr ratio was shown to increase. The study underscored the need to include LDB formulas into the current steel structure design specifications.",

For this purpose, a station from Konya province with climatic characteristics similar to Van province and a station from Kocaeli province with different climatic characteristics were selected. In all models, similar results between Van Local Station and the station selected from Konya were observed, while the results between Van Local Station and the station selected from Kocaeli were observed as relatively low compared to the previous comparison.

A type of self-healing concrete can be achieved by using microbial agents that induce calcium carbonate precipitation inside a concrete crack. Recently, biogranules consist of nitrate reducing microorganisms were presented as a new generation microbial healing agent and biogranule containing specimens revealed decent healing performance under completely submerged conditions. However, their performance under intermittent wetting conditions, a common case for various concrete structures, remains unknown. This study presents the self-healing performance of biogranule containing biomortar specimens under intermittent wet/dry conditions. In-house produced biogranules were incorporated into mortar specimens at a dose of 1.45% w/w cement (1.00% of bacteria w/w cement) and self-healing performance of cracked specimens were investigated under alternating wet/dry conditions for a crack width range of 50 to 600 µm. Upon alternating wet/dry treatment for 4 weeks, cracks up to a 400 µm crack width were effectively healed in biomortar specimens. Their water tightness regain was 44% better than control specimens due to their enhanced healing performance. Overall, non-axenic biogranules appear to be useful in development of self-healing bioconcrete for applications under spraying or intermittent wetting conditions.",

Deterministic input and output oriented BCC DEA models were compared with the stochastic models and stochastic measurement values were verified with the deterministic measurement values. The chance-constrained problems were created by uncertain data for stochastic DEA, then stochastic models were converted to deterministic equivalents and were linearized. Turkey's 21 electricity distribution companies have been accepted as decision-making units (DMUs) of DEA models. According to the efficiency results of deterministic and stochastic models, efficient and inefficient electricity distribution companies were determined. The objective is to add statistical noise to DEA models in the analyzed data and to obtain performance measurement in this direction. Noise element was included into the models within the scope of single factor symmetric error structure and the models were examined separately for each error level in order to examine the different results between the models.

Effects of four parameters were analyzed by statistical analysis of variance (ANOVA) and numerical optimization was performed by programs embedded in Design–Expert 6.0. Optimum conditions at the maximum conversion of 99.48% and steady state time of 1.69 hour were determined as WCO flow rate of 2.90 ml/min, methanol/oil molar ratio of 8.19 and reboiler heat duty of 0.419 kW by numerical optimization.

On the other hand, few studies have examined the abnormal increase in vibrations caused by interharmonics. In this study, in order to determine the effects of interharmonics on the vibration of the transformer core, the vibration displacement values in the core of a single-phase 10 kVA rated insulation transformer were examined under excitations with various interharmonic frequencies and the results have compared. In the simulation studies, it was concluded that depending on the interharmonic frequency, components appear as sidebands or double multiples of the relevant frequency in the vibration harmonic spectrum, but in some interharmonic frequencies, it leads to the emergence of components at fractional frequencies.",

A mesh independence study was carried out and the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model was selected for validation. Four various airfoil models were designed: M1 (airfoil without plain flap and rib structure), M2 (airfoil with rib structure), M3 (airfoil with a plain flap) and M4 (airfoil with a rib structure and plain flap). The performance of designed airfoils was calculated in terms of lift-to-drag (C_L/C_D) ratio. As a result, the plain flap significantly increased the lift coefficient (C_L) and drag coefficient (C_D). While the rib structure enhanced the aerodynamic performance of the non-flapped airfoil when the attack angle was greater than 12°, it increased the performance of the plain flapped airfoil at almost all attack angles. Furthermore, it was seen that the rib structure decreased C_D values of plain flapped airfoil at all attack angles and increased C_L values of plain flapped airfoil when the attack angle was greater than 2°.",

In this study, the design of a guidance kit which makes the mortar projectiles become guided when released from aerial platforms and the relevant computer simulations performed upon a selected projectile model are investigated. Here, two different configurations are considered based on the rotational degree of freedom of a pair of fins mounted on a rotary ring.

The fusion welding methods such as gas tungsten arc welding (TIG), Laser welding (LW), Electron beam welding (EBW), and Plasma arc welding (PAW) are widely used for dissimilar metals welding applications. Weld discontinuity such as solidification cracks and liquefaction cracks can occur in the weldment. One way to overcome these problems is to use a low heat input in the welding process. Force TIG welding machine, which has been developed in recent years, allows automatic welding with its integrated systems. Thus, it provides the opportunity to obtain the heat input homogeneously and to perform autogenous welding with its control of the welding parameters. The study aims to investigate the weldability of the Haynes 188 – AISI 316L couple, as supplied, automatically with the Force TIG welding machine, without opening the weld groove, and without using any filler metal (autogenously). For this purpose, the strength and hardness of the dissimilar welded sample were determined, and its microstructure was evaluated in detail.",

Measuring the thermal insulation performance of the buildings by scraping the plaster and examining the heat insulation material is not a viable solution when the size of the building stock of Türkiye is considered. In this study, detection of thermal bridges of the buildings by processing the thermal images of the buildings is proposed. The method is based on the binarization of the thermal image by the classification of the building elements as heat loss element or no heat loss element by analyzing the thermal image of the building. Global threshold methods and adaptive local threshold methods applied for binarization. All of the implemented methods require a threshold value for the classification. Determining a valid threshold value for all images is not possible therefore the threshold value is determined by the Otsu algorithm. Threshold determination process is executed both on the thermal image and the edge image. Obtained threshold values are implemented on the thermal images and the edge images. Local edge detection algorithms derived from the literature are compared by examining five thermal images and the comparison revealed that the Modified II Frei-Chen and Second-order Laplace operator provided the most suitable result. The case studies revealed that the thermal insulation performance of the existing building stock can be determined quickly, economically and reliably by implementing the proposed method.",

In addition, 8 (eight) and square drawings were plotted by using optimized PID parameters. The error comparison between the plotted drawings and the reference drawing was carried out according to the error values obtained by considering 11 different error criteria. After optimization, the percent accuracies for drawing 8 (eight) and the square drawing increase 2,0233% and 0,1711% in the X-Y plane respectively. The results obtained from the simulation and optimization studies of the system are presented and evaluated.",

        "abstract": "In the industry, additively manufactured components are becoming more prevalent. Rather than the growth in production of ordinary non-structural components by additive manufacturing, Additive manufacturing's increased safety-critical component production drives this prevalence. Thus, additive manufacturing of the braking system part, a vital subsystem in almost all vehicles, will help spread this manufacturing method. This study investigated the delamination issue noticed during the selective laser melting manufacture of the service brake caliper from 316L stainless steel. All process parameters were kept constant to investigate only the scanning strategy effect on the mechanical properties and delamination. On the samples, density-porosity measurements, tensile and hardness tests, and macrostructure examinations using an optical microscope were conducted. As a consequence of the studies, the chessboard scanning strategy exhibited superior mechanical properties over the stripe scanning strategy. The Chessboard method gave better results by 6% for measuring yield stress and by 12% for measuring Brinell hardness. The delamination was not entirely eliminated by the chessboard scanning strategy; however, it was noticed to be reduced in comparison to the stripe scanning strategy. Possible causes of delamination are discussed with microhardness measurements and optical microscope examinations.",

        "abstract": "In our current world, where the importance of productivity increases, it is of great importance that the engineering materials with superior properties can be shaped in the desired quality and under the most favorable conditions. Molybdenum and its alloys, which are refractory metals, are among the unique materials found in the production of the most critical parts of the whole in high-tech applications such as space, aviation, defense and biomedical industries. Refractory metals are known as difficult-to-cut materials, and their unit costs are relatively high. These properties of materials adversely affect processing efficiency and increase production costs. In this study, wear and tool life of the cutting tools were examined during the milling operation of pure molybdenum, TZM (titanium-zirconium-molybdenum) and MHC (molybdenum-hafnium-carbon) alloys. In the experimental study, optimum cutting tools and cutting parameters were determined by considering the publications in literature. As a result of the experiments, wear images of the cutting tools were taken by digital and scanning optical microscopes (SEM). In addition, EDX analysis was also carried out on these cutting tools. In all three material groups, rapidly increasing wear was observed on the cutting tools. Flank wear was observed in machining of pure molybdenum while crater wear in was observed in machining of TZM and MHC alloys. At 4800 m3 metal removal rate, the flank wear was 0.381 mm for pure molybdenum, 0.072 mm for TZM, 0.07 mm for MHC, while crater wear reached 5.85 mm2 for TZM and 8.348 mm2 for MHC. No crater wear was observed in pure molybdenum.",

In this study, an expansion agent was added to the brick raw material to reduce the unit weight of the brick and to increase the thermal insulation. Samples were produced by adding a mixture of expanding at certain rates. The produced samples were fired at 850, 900, 950, 1000, 1050 and 1100 oC to obtain 100×100×100 mm bricks. The unit volume weight, water absorption, void ratio, compressive strength, compressive strength after freezing-thawing and thermal conductivity properties of the produced bricks were investigated. According to the data obtained in the research, the optimum expansion chemical ratio is 15%. The most suitable firing temperature was determined as 1100 oC.

This systematic approach proposes the use of unused harmonic components of non-linear harmonic distortion produced by the semiconductor laser diode, which is used as a source in the infrastructure of the fiber optic communication system. In order to separate these unused harmonic distortion frequency components from the others, it is possible to add a protocol to each harmonic distortion difference frequency signal, or by intermodulation distortion (IMD) phase modulation, or to use both protocol and IMD phase modulation together. Thus, all harmonic distortion frequency components can be separated theoretically. Thus, it is recommended to use IMD difference frequency components in multi-tone-input subcarrier fiber optic or similar communication systems in the same transmission medium. We think that if this technique is used, it will make a great contribution to increasing the bandwidth of fiber optic communication and network systems.",

Therefore, this study deals with the evaluation of the liquefaction potential of a typical section representing the alluvial origin Adapazarı soils with the help of numerical analysis. The analyzes were carried out with Plaxis 2D software, and the soil section was modeled with the UBCSAND material model. In addition, in Adapazarı soil section with high liquefaction potential, the analyzes were repeated in order to determine the effect of soil improvement against liquefaction, in case of application of structural load and modeling of jet-grout columns under the structure. 1999 Marmara Earthquake was used as earthquake data. As a result of the analysis, certain analysis points were selected and the acceleration-time, displacement-time and pore water pressure changes at these points were examined. When the maximum acceleration values were examined at the mentioned analysis points, it was observed that there are soil amplifications due to the undamped liquefaction. In case of the displacement-time changes were examined, it was determined that the improvement reduced the horizontal displacements up to 59%. In addition, in the absence of improvement, pore water pressures reach total stress and liquefaction occurs; in the case of improvement, it was observed that liquefaction was prevented since the pore water pressures did not reach the total stress. Based on the results, it was determined that whether the model represents liquefaction behavior should be discussed in more detail.",

However, the scope of the problem has been differentiated and expanded due to the demands of real life. One of these situations is that customer demands are not limited to only one product type and a single warehouse is insufficient to meet customer demands. The border operations in recent years are carried out with the personnel reinforcement provided by the troops. In this study, the problem of the availability of pharmaceutical products against possible epidemic and diseases within the scope of military health logistics is discussed. Initially, the intense demand points of the troops working to ensure border security were determined. Then, a multi-product, multi-depot vehicle routing problem model was developed, which will transport 6 different product groups produced in the Military Pharmaceutical Factory to the troops with the help of the factory's 2 warehouses. As a result, the routes and distances covered using the existing vehicle fleet and warehouse centers have been revealed to meet the demands of the troops. Then, new results of the existing factory and vehicle fleet were obtained by expanding the problem size. The sensitivity analysis study was implemented for the distances obtained in the vehicle fleet changes used for both cases. Military health logistics is a strategic issue due to the necessity of keeping border areas ready for all kinds of adverse conditions. Due to the geopolitical position of our country, the study will be developed in the following years and will make the service provided to all of Turkey ready and effective for various needs.",

According to calculated loads; materials, bearings, belt, pulley, brake, and encoder were selected. In order to obtain a design in accordance with elevator standards, motor parts were examined for structural analysis. Finite element analyses were carried out according to the determined maximum static load values, and a new belt elevator traction motor design that provides the safety coefficients has emerged.  When the FEA analysis results of bending moments are examined; the maximum Von Mises stress acting on the motor frame and shaft was obtained 17.1 MPa and 27.62 MPa respectively. The maximum Von Mises stress was obtained under the torsional moment as 71.4 MPa and the shaft is 6.1 times safe against a torsional moment. This value is the minimum safety factor of the designed system and safety factors of bending moments are higher than this value. The designed elevator machine has got 12.9 kW rated power, 1.6 m/s cabin speed, and 1175 kg carrying capacity.

The number of dipping repetitions was 8 times, the dipping time was 90 seconds, the drying temperature between the processes was 110 °C, the time was 150 seconds, the annealing temperature was 500 °C and the duration was 2 hours. The effects of doping with Al and Cu metals with different physical properties on the surface, structural and optical properties of TiO2 thin films were investigated. The changes in the physical properties of TiO2 thin films were determined by increasing the doping ratios (1%, 3%, 5%). When SEM images are examined; It was determined that TiO2 thin films were deposited homogeneously on the glass substrates and Al doping reduced the particle size in the TiO2 film layers, while Cu doping increased the particle size. As a result of the calculations with the XRD analysis spectrum data, it was seen that the changes in particle size were compatible with the SEM images. For undoped TiO2 thin films, the known net peaks of TiO2 in the Anatase phase, the peaks caused by Al and Cu doping were detected in the XRD spectrum, and it was determined that the thin film was successfully deposited. When the optical properties were examined, the band gap was calculated as 3.21eV for the TiO2 Thin film. It was determined that the band gap of the TiO2 thin films increased with Al doping and the band gap decreased with Cu doping.",

In addition to that, a feed-forward controller is presented in order to improve the performance of the adaptive cruise control system. The mathematical model is obtained for N vehicles in the longitudinal direction between vehicles, where N is the number of vehicles in the vehicle convoy. Afterward, the cruise control of the vehicle convoy is performed with the linear-quadratic optimal regulator and the feed-forward controller design. The devised controller has been tested with numerical simulation studies and different velocity trajectory profiles for an eight-vehicle convoy.",

The aim of this study is to develop a general design guideline by examining the influence of basic design parameters such as magnet, tooth and tooth tip dimensions, air gap width, ratio of rotor outer diameter to inner diameter (split ratio), shaft diameter, etc. on the torque, torque ripple, efficiency and induced voltage for permanent magnet Vernier machines (PMVMs) used in low speed and high torque applications, such as wind turbine. The design and working principle of the PMVMs is briefly explained and it is emphasized how to choose the slot/pole combination that provides high torque despite low torque ripple. Afterwards, the design parameters are introduced and the waveform of back-EMF, which gives detailed information about the terminal voltage of each geometric parameter as well as the torque and efficiency, is parametrically analyzed. The most dominant geometric design parameters affecting the torque, efficiency and back-EMF were determined and the best design was obtained parametrically. Analyses were performed with a time-stepped, non-linear, two-dimensional finite element method (FEM) based program.",

The most important part of this target, electrification, is expected to form the basic strategy for reducing emissions, especially in road transport modes. Unlike many other sectors, the transportation sector is affected by behavioral movements as well as cost minimization. Therefore, the interaction between policy makers and consumers necessitates a system analysis on the axis of environment and energy. This study focuses on how road and rail transport, which constitutes a significant share of energy consumption in the transportation sector, can be positioned under current and applicable policies for the net zero emission target determined by Türkiye in the 2025-2050 period. For this purpose, scenarios were created using the Energy System Model for Türkiye (EST) designed for Türkiye. The implementation of policies such as the implementation of CO2 standards in the net zero scenario, the prohibition of new entries in internal combustion engine technologies, and the shifting of transportation preferences from road to rail, reveals the importance of the contribution of the transportation sector to the net zero emission target.",

In this study, the fatigue life of a mount of a device with shock absorber is investigated. Flight tests were carried out in real flight scenarios to provide an input for the analysis. A modal test was performed to model the shock absorbers correctly. Vibration test was performed to prove the accuracy of the prepared finite element model and to determine the damping ratios.

An AMR designed to examine the driving effects of caster wheels was analyzed in CoppeliaSim. The Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) file of the caster wheels, designed in the CAD program, was transferred to the CoppeliaSim program. Two different AMRs, which were 75 and 150 kg in total weight, were used to examine the effect of the weight of the AMR. Three types of caster wheels, which were single, double, and dual axial, were used in the analysis. The diameter, axis of rotation, and the total height of the caster wheel parameters were kept constant to compare wheels for each case. The results suggest that single caster wheels cause the most deviation in turns of AMR. The deviation in the double caster wheel is lower than on the single wheel. Furthermore, the lowest amount of deviation is in the dual axial caster wheels. Additionally, the deviations occurring in the AMRs with double caster and dual swivel caster are not affected by the weight of the AMR.",

The shot peening process is a mechanical surface treatment to enhance surface properties and fatigue strength. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effects of surface defects on the fatigue strength of 50CrV4 spring steel and the effect of shot peening process effects. Samples including a semicircular slit sized 0,2 mm or a hole sized 3 mm throughout the sample were shot-peened by S230 steel balls. 3-point bending tests were performed on defected and non-defected samples. It was found that the defects acted as a pre-existent crack and samples with hole and semicircular slit significantly reduced the fatigue strength by 85% and 80% (for 672 MPa), respectively. While shot peening enhanced the fatigue strength of the semi-circular slitted sample by 126%, it had almost no effect on the holed sample. Although shot peening increased the fatigue strength of the semi-circular slotted sample, it could not reach that of the non-defected sample. According to the results, it can be concluded that 3 mm hole and 0,2 mm scratch defects cannot be made harmless by the Shot Peening method.",

The results indicated that samples welded under pure argon and 1.5 % H2 + 98.5 % Ar showed similar kind of tensile behaviour. However, 5 % H2 +95 % Ar addition caused a decrease in tensile strength of the specimens due to porosity in the weld metal.

If the 18 pulse rectifier is designed properly, it is the minimum pulse number rectifier that is in compatible with the international standards without any additional circuits. On the other hand, unbalanced line voltages and voltage harmonics produce non-characteristic harmonics and increase the total harmonic distortion and then the rectifier operates out of the standards. In this line conditions, interphase transformers used at the outputs of the rectifier are become more important. In this study, a method has been developed to determine the optimum value of IPT in different line conditions. Compatibility of the developed method was tested and compared with MATLAB/Simulink simulations and the experimental results of 30kW rectifier test rig. It has been shown that the harmonic currents produced by the distorted line conditions can be reduced by the IPT inductance chosen properly",

However, in the standard only general principles and rules take place, does not include particle size determination of soils. But there are many article in international journals related with this method used for soils. Because laser diffraction method has many advantages over hydrometer/pipette method, and it is more reliable than hydrometer/pipette method, this method attracts many researchers.

The neutron wall load was taken at 5 MW/m2 and SS-304 alloy was used in the first wall. And also Li17Pb83 eutectic lithium was utilized for coolant in the fuel zone to supply heat transfer out of the blanket. 14.1 MeV D-T neutron source were used as a fusion neutron source. Neutron transport calculations were done with the aid of one dimensional computer system code of SCALE 5. Among the investigated reflector materials, graphite and ZrH2 showed better tritium breeding ratio (TBR) than others whereas ZrC had the worst performance. ZrH2 was determided the best neutron shielding because of minimal neutron leakage from the blanket. On the other hand, while ZrC showed better fissile fuel breeding, ZrH2 had the worst performance.

Theapproximate solutions of the fractional equation are based on cubic B-splinecollocation finite element method and L2 algorithm. The fractional derivativein the given equation is handled in terms of Caputo sense. Using the methods,fractional differential equation is converted into algebraic equation systemthat are appropriate for computer coding. Then, two model problems areconsidered and their error norms are calculated to demonstrate the reliabilityand efficiency of the proposed method. The newly calculated error norms showthat numerical results are in a good agreement with the exact solutions.",

On the other hand, saving energy and using the coolingsystems more efficiently are major concerns in today’s growing energy needs.Increasing the condenser capacity is one of the way of improving householdrefrigerator efficiency. In this study, first the performance test of a naturalcirculation wire-tube condenser was tested. Then the condenser was placed intoa tank and 2.5, 5, 7.5 and 10 liters of melted vegetable oil was filled intothe tank. Performance tests of the system were performed at both loaded andunloaded conditions as intermittent operation. A domestic refrigerator was runfor 2 hours as intermittent operation for each scenario. All measurements(pressure and temperature)   were taken at 5 minutes intervals.Experimental results showed that as the amount of oil in the oil-cooledcondenser increases, the condenser capacity and cooling capacity also increase,and also the energy consumption of the system decreases.  The energy consumption in unloaded operationof air-cooled condenser for 1 hour was measured as 90 Wh, and it decreased to35 Wh for oil-cooled condenser filled with 10 liters of oil. The COP of thesystem in unloaded operation of air-cooled condenser was calculated as 2.23 andthe energy consumption was about 90Wh. However, The COP of the system in loadedoperation of oil-cooled condenser was increased to 2.81 and the energyconsumption was decreased to 35Wh. On the other hand, the COP of the system inloaded operation of air-cooled condenser was measured as 2.14 and the energyconsumption of it was about 95Wh.

The result of this work is atheoretical and mathematical analysis of the unsteady thermal regime of flatsolar collectors on the modes of operation under consideration. Based on theresults of the analysis, it is possible to optimize individual structuralelements, as well as to predict the thermal regime and select alternativesolutions for the design of flat solar collectors and the choice of operatingmodes.",

The proposed system evaluates the vehicle’s physical limits,driver’s reaction and assists in making the most logical decision to avoid acrash using a sound or a similar stimulus. Typical driving simulator eventswere designed in MATLAB/Simulink and IPG/CarMaker co-simulation environment. Inthe predetermined scenario, the leading vehicles suddenly move into the hostvehicle’s lane and the driver is expected to avoid crash by either steering orbraking. The ESWS system generates a sound stimulus when it is determined thatthe crash is unavoidable with the use of service brakes and the only way toavoid the obstacle is steering. The simulation events were performed by a groupof participants using a driver simulator with and without the ESWS system. Theproposed ESWS encouraged participants to do an earlier and smoother steeringmaneuver which can be advantageous in some certain critical traffic situations.The statistical results showed that the sound stimulus reduced the drivers’reaction time significantly and a number of accidents can be avoided by thesuggested crash warning system.",

Because fuel valve is closed at idle speed, the fuel the engine needs to work comes through the throttle valve. Since efficiency of engine working on fuel that comes through this channel is very low, fuel consumption is quite high. However the state of high speed is characterized by wide open fuel valve and maximum air circulation, increasing fuel absorbtion to maximum. This study aims to experimentally measure and evaluate the mechanical vibrations taking place during the working of an experimental engine which has been structurally modified by the process of cylinder pacification to save fuel. It is essential that an an engine be able to work in harmony with all cylinders. In this study proper working of the engine had to be kept under control when two cylinders went dysfunctional. To this end vibration measures concerning smooth working of the engine in transition were taken. Satisfactory measures as well as as 29% of fuel save have been obtained",

There is significant potential for a reduction in environmental concerns on various types of projects; in the long-term, this technique may also prove to be an extremely sustainable form of ground improvement.  Consequently, the goal of the research described herein is to enhance the state-of-the-art with respect to our understanding of controlling biological cementation processes in soil. Bio-treatment of sand specimens was performed using a commonly encountered urea-producing soil microorganism called Sporosarcina Pasteurii (ATCC-6453). Microorganisms that were suspended in solution were introduced to the soil, and over time the microorganisms were supplied with necessary nutrients via cycling with a peristaltic pump. After bio-treatment, the specimens were back pressure saturated, isotropically consolidated, and sheared under undrained conditions. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) imaging was performed to examine the soil microstructure over a range of specimen curing periods to assess the nature of any cementitious bonds that may have formed.",

Energy-only trading through those venues might fall short in providing the required conditions for system reliability due to the well-known phenomenon of “missing money problem”. In order to avoid unintended loss of load, additional market mechanisms were developed in time. Several markets utilized capacity remuneration mechanisms to secure the system reliability through market-based or non-market-based models. Specifically, in Turkish electricity market, the regulator has implemented “direct payment” approach where generators fulfilling pre-determined conditions receive remunerations based on their installed capacities. This mechanism can be considered as a “quasi-market-based” model due to links to the market price formation. However, in principle, it should be categorized as a non-market-based model due to direct payments based on installed capacity levels. In this study, existing capacity remuneration mechanism in Turkey is analysed, an alternative market-based auctions model is developed and its results are simulated via Monte Carlo analysis. The study also elaborates on comparative advantages of the proposed market-based model over the existing approach and why it is a better option to preserve system reliability while being fully compliant with the electricity market reform goals.",

Among the different patterns that were formed, the pattern consisting of narrower inter indent spacing and lower indent depth was found to show the optimum properties. Surface roughness and new structure formation (structures with oxide and calcium-phosphate) behaviors were not directly correlated, and it was suggested that this behavior stemmed from the effect of the microdeformation patterns on the dislocation mechanism as an important factor in increasing the surface energy. After the 3-days immersion period, in comparison with the control sample it was determined that the microdeformation patterns formed on the sample surfaces, which triggered dislocation mechanisms, positively affected the precipitation of oxide and calcium-phosphate structures by increasing the roughness and surface energy on the sample surface.",

For many years, methods of motion analysis based on image processing techniques have been employed to detect hand motions. However, recent research has focused on utilizing muscle contraction for detecting hand movements. Specifically, there has been an increase in studies that classify hand movements using surface electromyography (sEMG) data from the muscles of the hand and arm. In our study, we estimated the open (extension of the fingers) and closed (flexion of the fingers) positions of the hand by analyzing EMG data obtained from 4 volunteer participants' Extensor digitorum and Flexor carpi radialis muscles. In order to accurately discriminate EMG signals, various statistical measures such as variance, standard deviation, root mean square, average energy, minimum and maximum features were utilized. The dataset containing these additional features was then subjected to classification algorithms including Support Vector Machines (SVM), K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Decision Tree (DT), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) for the purpose of classifying hand positions into open or closed states. Among the tested algorithms, SVM achieved the highest success rate with a maximum accuracy of 73.1%, while KNN yielded the lowest success rate at a minimum accuracy of 55.9%. To further enhance prediction accuracy in future studies, it is suggested that data from a larger set of muscles be collected.",

PV cells and modules were modeled with the single diode model (SDM) and double diode model (DDM) and tested with actual measurement data. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) was chosen as the objective function, and the results were compared with the evaluation metrics for computational accuracy and time. Based on four PV model results, RMSE values were calculated between 9.9318E-04 to 1.7011E-03 for HBA and between 9.8602E-04 and 1.7298E-03 for WHO.

The limited reserves of fossil fuels have increased the tendency towards alternative energy sources due to reasons such as harming the environment and causing global warming. Some renewable energy sources are sun, wave, wind, biomass, and others. Among them are the most preferred solar energy systems. Before implementing any photovoltaic (PV) project, technological and economic feasibility is required to optimize electricity generation, reliability, and costs. As of today, various simulation tools have been created to predict and optimize a PV system. This study examined the differences between the results obtained from photovoltaic solar energy systems designed using PVsyst and MATLAB/Simulink software and how these differences affect the energy production and performance of the systems. Regression analysis was performed by comparing the output data with each other, and it was determined which direction was advantageous or disadvantageous. 75 kW PV system was designed in Ankara using PVsyst and MATLAB/Simulink software, and the simulation outputs obtained from the two software were compared. Three different PV systems were designed and numbered: Design-1: PVsyst System, Design-2: MATLAB/Simulink with MPPT Algorithm, and Design-3: MATLAB/Simulink without MPPT Algorithm. The monthly differences between the two software and the three design outcomes are highly variable. These differences are between 0.36% and 10.72% in Design-1 with Design-2. It is between 14.21% and 43.71% in the Design-1 with Design-3.  It is between 17.65% and 49.32% Design-2 with Design-3. According to analysis findings, it has been determined that the sensitivity of the MATLAB/Simulink software to temperature change is higher than the PVsyst software. In addition, reasons such as the variable MPPT algorithms and the automatic or manual entry of the data are also effective in the difference.",

For different panel row spacings, the system performances were compared using a constant tilt angle of 35°, expressed as a proper angle for PV installations at the considered location. In addition, the optimum tilt angle is found for four different cases in terms of electricity generation. In systems with 35° tilt angles at electricity were produced annually as 622.77 MWh, 566.49 MWh, 495.36 MWh, and 385.72 MWh, respectively, for panel row spacings of 2 m, 2.5 m, 3 m, and 4 m.

Similarly, the Performance Ratio (PR) values obtained with the optimum angles are 20.61%, 8.39%, 4.12%, and 1.44%, higher than the fixed tilt angle cases. According to the economic analysis, systems with a fixed tilt angle for these panel row spacings pay back themselves in 5.13, 4.67, 4.44, and 4.28 years, respectively, while systems at optimum angles pay back themselves in a shorter time by 5.83%, 4.26%, 2.49%, and 0.91%.

        "abstract": "Battery core and surface temperature are crucial for the thermal management and safety usage of Li-ion batteries. They affect the cell's physical properties and strongly correlate with some of its key states, such as the battery state of charge (SOC) and state of health (SOH). Therefore, an accurate estimate of the battery core and surface temperature will enhance the performance and prolong the battery's life. This study proposes an estimation system of the battery core and surface temperature. A simplified pseudo-two-dimensional model is introduced to capture the battery SOC, core and surface temperature that will be used later in this study to model and validate the results' accuracy. Then, a two-state thermal battery model (TSM) is presented and studied. The recursive least square (RLS) algorithm is adopted to identify the thermal parameters of the battery. Next, the TSM is validated using COMSOL Multiphysics simulation software and the thermal parameters are then fed to the Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the battery core temperature. Finally, the accuracy of the battery core temperature estimated results are validated with a root mean square error of 0.037K.",

Today, various chemical, biological, and physical pollutants arising as a result of rapidpopulation growth, industrialization, and excessive mining activities have become a major problem that adversely affects people, animals, plants, organisms, and ecosystems all over the world. Sepiolite is a clay mineral containing hydrated magnesium silicate and widely used in construction, agriculture, food, fertilizer, pharmaceutical, detergent, cosmetics, paint, paper, etc. The average concentrations of Al, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Rb, Sr, Zr, Cd, Sn, Ba and Pb analyzed in sepiolite samples collected from three quarries (Polatlı, Beylikova, and Sivrihisar) located in the Central Anatolian Region of Turkey using EDXRF spectroscopy were found as 5456.5, 361.0, 42.0, 15.5, 65.2, 3831.5, 8.6, 23.7, 7.8, 11.8, 5.3, 13.7, 1183.2, 25.3, 3.7, 7.2, 131.9 and 5.3 mg/kg, respectively. The average enrichment factor values of V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Sr, Cd, Sn, Ba, and Pb indicated minimal to extremely high enrichment in sepiolite. The values of non-carcinogenic risk index and cancer risk estimated to evaluate potentially health risks caused by PTEs in sepiolite samples were within the acceptable limit and the safe range except for the Beylikova quarry.",

In this work, Sr containing Al12Si alloy was used. For the modification process, 100, 200 and 300 ppm Sr was added to the alloy. The oxidation tests were carried out in liquid state at 700, 750 and 800 °C for holding durations of 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours. The structure was characterised by optical microscopy, Scanning Electron Microscopy, X-Ray Diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques.

Rice husk was calcined at 700 °C for 2 hours and rice husk ash was obtained. It was homogenized for 10 minutes with a molar ratio of carbon black at C/SiO2 of 4. Carbothermal reduction processes were carried out in an atmosphere-controlled tube furnace. After that GP composites were produced using synthesis SiC particles. Potassium silicate solution and metakaolin were mixed in a mechanical mixer. Synthesis SiC were added to the slurry prepared in this way at a rate of 5-15% by weight, and the mixture was homogenized. For mechanical tests, bending specimens according to ASTM C78/C78M-18 standard and compression specimens according to ASTM C1424-10 standard prepared and three-point bending and compression tests were performed. As a result, as the bending strength increases due to the increasing amount of reinforcement, the Weibull distribution exhibits a wide confidence interval, while the compressive strength shows a narrower confidence interval, while the opposite situation is observed. When both situations are assessed, 5-10% synthesis SiC supplementation is seen as the working window.",

However, skin images can contain noise such as hair.  These noises affect the accuracy of segmentation.  In our study, we created a noise dataset. It contains 3000 images and masks. We performed noise removal and lesion segmentation by utilizing the ISIC and PH2. We have developed a new deep learning model called U-Net-RCB7.  U-Net-RCB7 contains EfficientNetB7 as the encoder and ResNetC before the last layer.  This paper uses a modified U-Net model.

The company's annual energy and material losses have become seriously important to the Libyan government's research field. The well-established data mining and classification software package known as the WEKA tool is used to minimize these losses,. As necessary data input for algorithms; six different parameters are taken into consideration, namely power production size, energy production duration, energy production date, ambient temperature, humidity level and wind speed. This study is examined in detail for the first time in this article. In addition, considering the temperature variables, humidity, wind and other atmospheric effects of the environment, the energy losses of the company and the country are reduced to a minimum level. As a result, the company's annual electricity consumption is classified as low, medium or high consumption with the simulations. Thus, in cases where energy consumption is high, it is possible to make accurate and rapid decisions regarding the determination and classification of time periods related to energy consumption.",

        "abstract": "Repeated loads in the road structure decrease the service life of the pavement and increase the maintenance costs with the increase in deformations such as rutting and superficial or deep crack formation. The use of steel slag, which is a by-product of iron-steel production, instead of natural aggregate, is becoming very common for both resource scarcity and waste disposal. Since the use of steel slag will be beneficial in terms of mechanical and environmental conditions due to its resistance to some seasonal changes and fatigue behavior, it is preferred to be used as a substitute for natural aggregates in layers such as foundation, sub-floor, cement coating, etc in the road superstructure design. In this way, both the use of natural resources will be reduced and the damage to nature will be minimized by the use of waste slag, which is constantly increasing. In this study, the effect of using steel slag on the foundation or sub-base layers was investigated by performing dynamic analyses with the finite element method. As a result of numerical analyzes carried out under repeated wheel loads of 400 kPa, the vertical deformation values obtained as a result of the use of steel slag material in the subbase layer were lower than the deformation values in the use of limestone-containing aggregate, which is another material in the literature. The findings show that the minimum deformation values in the first 50 loading steps occur in the CC and KC sections, respectively.",

The effect of the injection timings from 15 °CA to 23 °CA (bTDC) with 2 °CA increments was also studied at 60% load and constant speed of 2400 rpm. Experimental results showed that IBE blends with diesel fuel delayed the combustion at low load while increasing load reduced this delay when compared with diesel fuel. An increase in cylinder gas pressure up to 5.7% and rate of heat release up to 42% in using IBE was observed. Regarding emissions, despite no significant change in CO emission was observed with the load and IBE ratio; UHCs increased up to 35% at low load conditions; however, they reduced at 60% load. While smoke opacity reduced up to 64% with IBE30 when compared with diesel fuel, NOx emissions increased about 10%. The decrease in injection advance caused a decrease in pressure and heat release rate, while NOx emissions increased gradually up to 54% with increasing injection advance.",

The fluid on the underside of the plate was is assumed to be stationary. The linear piston theory can be applied to the top surface of the plate. The linear piston theory was used to evaluate the aerodynamic loads. The solution of a complex eigenvalue problem was formulated according to Hamilton’s principle. Lagrange’s equation of motion was obtained using standard methods for finding eigenvalues. Current finite element analysis ignores aerodynamic damping. For panels, the theory of thin and small deformed shells was taken into account. To validate the developed finite element code, the results of a square and rectangular flat-panels with simply supported edges (S-S-S-S), a square plate with four fixed edges (C-C-C-C), and a square plate with the length side clamps (C-S-C-S) were compared with the published data. The flutter results of other edge boundary conditions (S-C-S-C, C-S-C-S, and C-C-C-C) for square and rectangular flat panels are evaluated for which literature data is limited. It has been found that the fixed condition in the cross-flow direction (S-C-S-C) has a significant effect on the critical flutter pressure parameters and flutter frequencies. Further, to study the aforementioned effect, the current finite element (FE) has been extended to curved plates with S-C-S-C(constrained in the cross-flow direction and exposed to supersonic flow), SS-S-S boundary conditions to find flutter results.",

Recent developments in solar thermoelectric generator have achieved several improvements as a result of its optimized systems such as concentrated systems and also the boosts from nanotechnology. In this study, a concentrator thermoelectric generator (CTEG) using Graphene Nanoplatelets (GNPs), and Multiwall Carbon Nanotubes (MWCNTs) dispersed in distilled water as base fluid was investigated experimentally. The CTEG system was designed, constructed in Karabük University Energy Systems labs, Turkey and have been commissioned outdoor by testing, balancing and adjusting. Experiments were performed for 0.25 wt.% nanoparticle mass concentration of MWCNTs-distilled water and GNPs-distilled water nanofluids with a constant volume rate of flow (ν ̇=0.5 L/min). Experiments study aimed to study effect of nanoparticle types on thermal and electrical energetic efficiency. The obtained results showed that the CTEG is enable to generate (Emax=3.7 W) of electrical power output for an average temperature difference of 38°C. MWCNTs-distilled water nanofluid presented an enhancement in electrical performance more than GNPs-distilled water nanofluid and distilled water, while GNPs-distilled water nanofluid presented maximum thermal increment. The total efficiency for the day-long periods were 16.34%, 24.03% and 20.21% for distilled water, GNPs-distilled water, MWCNTs-distilled water respectively. The results of the study made a solid basics about the prospects of CTEG applications related with nanotechnology to be one of the potential choices for cooling technique by using different types of nanofluids as coolants.",

        "abstract": "Increasing environmental concerns with climate change have led many people around the world to demand urgent action, forcing national governments to seek alternatives to carbon-based fuels. In the light of all this, it is of critical importance for our civilization that carbon-based energy sources are rapidly replaced by renewable and sustainable sources without carbon emissions. For this reason, the use of these clean energy sources and the efficiency of the processes in their production is a very important issue. In this study, 3-dimensional, two-phase (hydrogen and water) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis was performed in a polymer electrolysis membrane cell (PEM). Analysis took place for 30 seconds. The water flow rate was kept constant at 260 ml/min. As a result of the analysis, pressure, gas volume fraction and velocity data in the manifolds and in the electrolysis channels where the electrolysis process takes place were interpreted. While the pressure change in the cell was quite high in the range of 0-1.8 seconds from the beginning of the flow, it was observed that a balance was formed in the pressure distribution after 1.8 seconds. It is understood that the number of channels in the model is a factor for the pressure inside the manifold and the cell. However, it was observed that the unit gas production amount in the cell also changed along the channels.",

The study explores how these applications, with varying heat inputs, affect the mechanical and microstructural properties of the materials. Filler metal of SG2/S2 non-alloy steel grade wires was employed. The variable parameters chosen included surface conditions, coating thickness, and heat input. It was observed that altering the coating thicknesses and welding methods led to welding defects. Non-destructive tests indicated that surface conditions and welding methods somewhat influenced the weld joint. Specimens with a thickness of 75 µm exhibited poor performance in tensile, impact, and bending tests. Fractography studies validated these findings.",

An effective supplier selection running is also needed to continue the process in harmony. The issue of supplier selection is one of the multi-criteria decision-making problems that requires consideration of many qualitative and/or quantitative factors. In this study, Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method with interval type-2 fuzzy sets, which are more flexible and successful in reflecting uncertainty for fuzzy decision-making problems with contradictory criteria, was proposed to evaluate the overall performance of suppliers. In order to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method, an empirical study was conducted on the evaluation of material suppliers for an automotive manufacturer and a comparative scenario analysis was performed to investigate the effect of different criteria under different conditions.",

In this study, the welded joint performance of 3Cr12 ferritic stainless steel materials joined with different addition wires was investigated. In the study, ER308LSi, ER309LSi and ER316LSi welding wires were used as additional wires and joined by the gas arc welding method. No errors were observed in the visual inspection performed after the joining process. Macrostructure and microstructure examinations were performed to determine the structural characterisation of the specimens, and tensile, hardness and bending tests were performed to determine the mechanical characterisation. In macro studies; weld metal (WM) and heat affected zone (HAZ) can be clearly distinguished. There are no defects such as gaps, cracks and lack of penetration that could negatively affect the weld quality and mechanical properties. In micro examinations, structural changes and the melting-solidification line between WM and the base metal were clearly identified. In tensile tests, the % elongation, yield and tensile strength values of the joints made with ER308LSi wire showed slightly better results than the joints made with other wires. In hardness tests, average hardness values were measured as approximately 150 HV in the base metal, 300 HV in HAZ, and 190 HV in WM. In bending tests, it was determined that welded joints exhibited approximately as much ductility as the material.",

AISI 4140 steel is also among the steels that can be nitrided. With the nitriding process, thanks to the hard nitride layer obtained on the surface, not only a wear-resistant surface is provided, but also an increase in fatigue strength. In this study, the microstructural and surface properties of AISI 4140 steel, which has been treated with low pressure gas nitrocarburizing and post-oxidation process at different times, has been investigated. For this aim, AISI 4140 steel samples were austenitized at 850 °C for 60 min and quenched into oil at 60 °C. After quenching, the samples were tempered at 630 °C for 60 min. Gas nitrocarburizing process steps; pre-oxidation at 350 °C for 45 minutes, nitriding at 550 °C for 90 minutes and nitrocarburizing at 550 °C for 480 minutes were applied, and then the samples were subjected to post-oxidation using steam for 45 to 180 minutes. Microstructural characterization studies were performed by optical microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrum analysis (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis, microhardness and surface roughness measurements. The X-ray analysis results revealed that the surface layer of the samples consisting of iron-nitride phases of ɛ-Fe2-3N and ɣ’-Fe4N during nitrocarburizing and iron oxide (Fe3O4). It was determined that the iron oxide (Fe3O4) layer thickness increased with increased post-oxidation time. Among the AISI 4140 steel samples that nitrocarburized and post-oxidized, the best combination of hardness depth, surface hardness, and surface roughness was obtained after 150 minutes of post oxidation.",

Importance of electricity energy demand maintains its increasing trend in line with growing population, urbanization, industrialization, becoming widespread of technology and welfare. While meeting electricity energy demand, correct and effective load forecasting is needed in order to ensure operational safety without losing the stability of voltage, frequency and power flows within the limits determined under the real time conditions of electric power systems, operate and plan secure and low-cost electricity transmission systems and supply sustainable, reliable, high quality and affordable electricity to consumers. In recent years, use of the artificial intelligence models are quite common in many areas of the power system analysis and control, static and dynamic security analysis, dynamic load modelling and alarm processing and error diagnostics. Therefore, in this study, hybrid artificial neural network model optimized with genetic algorithm has been proposed to perform short-term load forecast since fairly good forecasting results are being obtained especially for non-linear complex problems. The proposed short-term load forecasting model has been tested by making 24 hours load forecasting using actual load data of Ankara Region in Turkey. The results obtained from the proposed model have been compared with classical ANN. In this study, for short-term electric load forecasting based on artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm an adaptive hybrid system has been proposed. Using artificial neural network based on Genetic Algorithm (GA) a new approach for short-term electric load forecasting has been developed. This proposed hybrid algorithm has been implemented for short-term load forecasting. In the proposed model, the actual forecast was made by ANN, Genetic Algorithm is used to select the most appropriate activation function for each node of ANN. Thus, it has been observed that network error decreased even more than classical ANN. The results show that hybrid ANN gives better result than classical ANN. So, the accuracy of the proposed model for short-term load forecasting has been increased. These results showed that the proposed model has a higher accuracy rate than the classical ANN in the short-term load forecasting.",

Another purpose of using alternative fuel to petroleum in diesel engines is to release fewer polluting emissions to the environment. Although it releases clean emissions in alternative fuels, it is also desirable to have high engine efficiency. Biodiesel is the best alternative to diesel fuel in diesel engines. In addition, the reduction of efficiency loss in engines is achieved by reducing the amount of friction and wear between the ring-cylinder couple. In this study; The friction and wear behavior of biodiesel fuel, which is widely used as an alternative fuel in diesel engines, between the ring-cylinder couple was compared with diesel fuel. The study consists of three stages; In the first stage of the study, the experimental parameters that give the optimum conditions of friction and wear characteristics were determined by using the Taguchi method. In the second stage, the tribological properties of diesel and biodiesel fuel were investigated by conducting an experimental study. In the last stage of the study, the wear mechanism between the ring-cylinder pair was modeled with artificial neural networks (ANN). With the work done; It has been determined that the friction coefficient of biodiesel is lower than diesel fuel and therefore the amount of wear is lower. Optimum conditions when the amount of wear is compared; biodiesel fuel was obtained under 150 rpm and 40 N load. Experimental results were predicted by the developed ANN model. In this way, the tribological properties between the ring-cylinder pair can be examined by reducing the number of experiments.",

In this study, the energy, exergy, and Life Cycle Climate Performance (LCCP) of R449A, which has a lower GWP value, which can be an alternative to R404A refrigerant, were investigated theoretically. Different evaporator temperatures (-30oC to -5oC) and a condenser temperature (30oC) were used in the analysis. According to the results obtained, while the mass flow rate of R449A is approximately 13% lower than that of R404A, its exergy efficiency is 5% higher.

The results show that R600 has better performance characteristics than R123.

Green and sintered densities together with hardness of the samples were determined. 400 MPa pressure, 600 sintering temperature and 40 min sintering duration were found to be suitable for the production of these samples. Hardness and transverse rupture tests were carried out on the sintered samples. One batch of the samples were artificially aged at 160°C for 15, 20, 25 hours after solution treatment at 500°C and then cooled to room temperature by water quenching. Another batch of the samples were artificially aged at 130°C for 15, 25, 40 hours after solution treatment at 470°C and cooled to room temperature by water quenching. Microstructural and mechanical properties of the aged samples were determined. Optimum mechanical properties were found on the sample which was solution treated at 500°C and aged at 160°C for 25 hours",

An effective algorithm was developed and used to detect the fingerprint singularities from gray level fingerprint images. In order to improve the performance of the system, fingerprint image enhancement was performed by using a mask. Binary images were obtained from the enhancement images using a regional binarization algorithm. Binary images were converted to thin images. Ridge endings and ridge bifurcations of the fingerprints (minutiae) were extracted. A postprocessing algorithm was used to eliminate false minutiae patterns and the fingerprint matching process was finally applied. In order to automatise the system, a software for fingerprint identification and verification was developed in Delphi. 100 fingerprint images were used for identification and verification. The system developed in this work achieves the task with high accuracy",

Firstly, spheroidization proces of lamellae cementite phases was practiced at 705 °C for 5 hours below Ac1 eutectiod temperature in the sintered parts. In the second sphreoidization route, the sintered specimens were firstly austenisated at 850 °C for 6 min and then immediately quenched in water medium at room temperature to obtain fully martenzitic structure in the microstructure. Then, to produce fine spherical cementite dispersion in the specimens having martenzitic structure, the specimens were annealed at 505 °C and 705 °C temperatures for 5 hours separately. At the end of these spheroidization treatments, it was understood that there wasn’t a direct relation between hardness and impact toughness; however, the toughness was more related to morphology and dispersion of cementite in the microstructure. In terms of hardness and impact toughness, properties of specimens spheroidizated from martenzitic structure were higher in comparison to classical spheroidization route",

        "abstract": "The communication model between federates and the federation is an important point that should be considered carefully when d esigning runtime infrastructure (RTI) software. Some of the communication methods and protocols used in existing closed-source systems include shared memory, UDP and TCP/IP. Portico has a very special place among other open source RTIs since it has a well-written code, flexible architecture and it is actively supported by its developers. Portico RTI currently has 2 different communication models. First of these models is Jgroups based communication model. Jgroups is an IP multicast based library. Federates, distributed over network, can communicate with each other and run together by following the HLA (High Level Architecture) standard rules. Since Jgroups is a network based library, it may cause some latency. The need for new communication models has risen for the scenarios where simulations run on the same computer. As a result of this need, JVM (Java Virtual Machine) communication model has been developed for Portico RTI. Simulations, running on the same computer, are invoked as separate threads in JVM model which has some deficiencies. Failing one of simulation threads may cause JVM process to fail which in turn makes other simulations fail which breaks the interoperability rule. Another problem of JVM model is that a wrapper class is needed to invoke simulations as separate threads. This prevents simulations from running directly without any need for a wrapper class. A need for new communication models have raised because of the deficiencies current communication models have. In shared memory model, simulations run as separate processes and communicate through a shared memory region. Shared memory model overcomes the problems JVM model has and provides a faster communication model to simulations. JNI (Java Native Interface) technology will be used in order to realize memory operations in Portico which is a Java based software. Not only shared memory model but also a hybrid communication model will be presented in this paper. In hybrid communication model, simulations running on the same computer will communicate through shared memory model and simulation running on different computers will communicate through Jgroups communication model. Both shared memory and hybrid communication model perform better than Jgroups communication model. Since both hybrid and shared memory communications model have not been developed for Portico until now, this study proposes new communication models for Portico and improves the total communication times of simulations communicating through Portico",

This optimization problem, mostly called energy management of hybrid electric vehicles aims to find the minimum consumed fuel energy flow, in other words fuel consumption over the entire trip. This study describes the application of theoretical global optimization method called Dynamic Programming (DP) and a practical approach substitute, namely Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) to a parallel hybrid powertrain energy management problem and their virtual tests in various drive-cycles. The computational burden of DP has been relaxed by ECMS approach and sub-optimal behaviour is rather comparable to global optimal behaviour. Finally, ECMS is enhanced by novel method based on predictive information to anticipate upcoming road topology in order to fully benefit either the free recuperation energy over long downhill road sections or via pre-charging strategy against uphill road sections",

        "abstract": "Market demand has been pushing the truck manufacturers to provide trucks with more engine power and torque to the market. This demand is essentially related to the performance expectation of the customers to have high wheel torques available. In addition to the performance increase, also the customer expectations have increased on other attributes such as Noise Vibration Harshness (NVH), vehicle dynamics and etc. Driveability has also become an important attribute of the vehicle. A product needs to be developed to satisfy these expectations related to the stated attributes. This necessity brings up the need of analysis of driveability and driveability error states, which will be more obvious because of high torques in the driveline. High torques in the driveline is a result of the high transmission ratio and engine torques in the driveline. Within the scope of the presented work, three vehicle models reflecting driveline components in different detail levels are created in Matlab environment in order to perform the mentioned analysis of driveability and driveability error states. The transient maneuver results obtained from these models are compared to test results of the real vehicle. The results show that in order to analyze the driveability and driveability error states, the elastic driveline model where the drive shafts are modelled is sufficient. The contribution of the tire models to reflect driveability is limited",

Furthermore, the relationship between the consumption of HTS wires and the volume of the single-/double-polarity HTS-DSDDGs is quantitatively investigated to determine the excitation operating points of HTS coils. Since the different placement strategies of HTS coils will lead to differences of the excitation operating points, as well as differences of generator size and HTS wires consumption, the single-/double-polarity HTS-DSDDGs are compared in terms of the electromagnetic performance, the weight and the material cost. Finally, the conclusion is drawn that the 10 MW double-polarity HTS-DSDDG is lighter and lower cost than the single-polarity one.",

In this respect, many countries are undertaking significant roles to decline their energy intensities (energy supply or consumption per unit of economic output) whereas this variable may be single factor for the international comparisons. This study including many factors with the energy intensity measures energy efficiency of countries and positions Turkey among them. Data envelopment analysis (DEA) using multiple input and outputs is a non-parametric technique for the efficiency evaluation of a set of decision making units (DMUs). In the analyzes, the OECD and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, Democratic People of China and South Africa) countries were used for 2009–2013 period. For this period, the Malmquist productivity index (MPI) method was also used to observe the dynamic progress of DEA analyzes. The efficiency analysis of OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries is conducted from 2009 to 2013. According to the results, the efficient countries are members of the OECD group and MPI of an average country worsens 1.4% over the period. As a member of OECD, Turkey is not efficient country with the score of 0.048 and Turkey’s MPI also worsens 4.5% for the whole period. Because the energy imports have become a threat to Turkey’s economy in recent years, the findings will be helpful guidance in seeing its relative position and in taking precautions. As a result of this study, it is given some suggestions to increase the efficiency of Turkey in the model.",

Three different k-eand four different k-wturbulencemodels are employed. Aluminum oxide Al2O3-water andcopper oxide CuO-water are used as nanofluids. Volume fractions ofnanoparticles used are 0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, 1%, 2% and 4%. Reynolds number changes from3×103to 50×103. Results showed that k-ωstandard turbulence model with low Reynolds numbercorrection gives better result. It is seen that both the type and volumefraction of nanofluid affect heat transfer and pressure drop. Using Al2O3and CuO nanoparticles in water increases thermal performance. It is found thatthe performance of CuO-water nanofluid is better than that of Al2O3-waternanofluid.

Geotechnical considerations areparticularly important in identifying the conditions leading to instability of shallowand deep foundations under various loadings. In the case the foundation layeris clay, one should identify the conditions leading to failure of clay soil uponloading. The most common way of doing so is to theorize the constitutivebehavior of the soil using mathematical equations. In this study, constitutivemodeling of clays under monotonic loadings is presented using the GeneralizedPlasticity Theory. Numerical formulation is summarized in terms of governingequations which are solved for each load step by an explicit integration methodwhich is implemented into a computer program. Elasto-plastic constitutivematrix is derived based upon the inversion of strain-stress relationshipwithout using a yield or a potential function in the model which is used to getthe stress-strain incremental relationship. Plastic strains are then calculatedusing a non-associative flow rule. Subsequently, a number of drained andundrained strain-controlled triaxial tests are simulated to verify the modeland its implementation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness andthe capability of the model to capture static behavior of normally andoverconsolidated clays.",

One of the most important factors affecting turbineperformance is the change in aerodynamic performance of the aerofoil model. Theaerodynamic performance of the NACA-0018 aerofoil model, which is likely to beused in wind turbine blades, has been investigated numerically andexperimentally. Numerical studies for performance analysis were studied usingANSYS FluentTM14,5 software, which is based on computational fluiddynamics (CFD), using SST (Shear Stress Transport) turbulence model. Innumerical studies, Reynolds (Re) number was accepted as 5,7x104, andthe analyses were repeated for every 2,5° angle of attack from 0° to 60°.Experimental studies were carried out in the open loop wind tunnel between0°-60° for every 5° angle of attack. In both studies, the lift coefficient (CL),drag coefficient (CD) and aerodynamic efficiency (CL/CD)values of the NACA-0018 aerofoil model were determined for selected attackangles. According to the numerical results, a stall occurred at 32,5° angle ofattack for the AR1 model, while at 25° for the AR2 model. Considering with theresults of experimental study for AR1 and AR2, the CLvalue of bothmodels was 0,41% and 2,71% better than the data obtained as a result ofnumerical studies, respectively. Similarly, it was concluded that theexperimentally obtained CDvalues were 6.35% and 5.16% better thanthe numerical data for the AR1 and AR2 models, individually. As a result ofnumerical study, the CL/CDvalues obtained for AR1 andAR2 were 3.86% and 12.04% higher for each aerofoil model than the experimentaldata for the same structures. As a consequence of both experimental andnumerical study, the aerodynamic efficiency of the AR1 structure from thestructures of NACA-0018 aerofoil models having two different aspect ratios hada significant advantage compared to the AR2 before and after the stall.",

        "abstract": "Physicaland motor disability is a disorder that greatly limits some of the individualmain life activities. These disorders affect children in many countries of theworld. In addition, it is a difficult process for physically and motorlydisabled individuals to be classified by doctors with appropriate occupationaltreatments. Because, there are many variables that must be considered. The aimof this study is to classify the self-care skill problems of children withphysical and motor disabilities by the minimal error using deep neural networks(DNN). For this purpose, DNN models with different parameters were created. Thenumber of hidden layers, the number of neurons in the hidden layers, theactivation function, the optimization algorithm, the loss function and theepoch value are taken into consideration in the creation of the models. The DSAmodels were trained and tested with the SCADI (Self-Care Activities Datasetbased on ICFCY) data set. The classification performance of the models wasdemonstrated by using the F-1 score, precision (P), recall (R) and accuracy(ACC) metrics. Details of the 8 models with the best grading performance arepresented. According to the findings, the best classification performance wasobtained in the DSA-1 model using Adadelta optimization algorithm, Eluactivation function and Categorical crossentropy loss function. The P, R, ACC andF1 scores of this model are 1. In other words, this model predicts theself-care skills problems of physical and motor disability children with 100%accuracy. In addition, in order to increase the validity of the three bestmodels (DSA-1, DSA-2 and DSA-3), the training and testing process was performedwith 10-fold cross-validation method. Mean cross validation accuracy valueswere calculated as 85.71%, 85.71% and 87.14% respectively. Occupationaltherapists can be used developed DSA models as a validating tool for diagnosingself-care problems.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, iterative thermal design model of a superheater-desuperheater system mounted a steam boiler working at pressure of 7.5 bar(g) was completed using Mathcad and findings were interpreted with performance analysis. Aim of the desuperheater (atemperator) in the system is to reduce steam temperature to desired values at superheater outlet. Boiler system having Superheater-desuperheater was also investigated at load cases of %100, %80, %60, %50 and %40, and then, this model was prepared with system scenario containing a superheater without desuperheater in terms of boiler and superheater heat values. As a result of the study, it was determined that desuperheater addition has a positive effect on system heat capacity under proper load cases. Based on the study results, it was commented that superheater-desuperheater addition not only can be used because of construction limitations but can be preferred in order to increase boiler efficiency as well.",
